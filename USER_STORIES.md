- Mobile (<640px): Single column, stacked layout
- Tablet (640-1024px): Two-column, compact
- Desktop (>1024px): Full layout, sidebar
- Large desktop (>1280px): Wide layout, max-width container

**Given** I use a mobile device

- Bottom sheets for modals
- Collapsible sections
- Horizontal scrolling where appropriate
- Mobile-optimized navigation (hamburger menu)

**Given** I use a tablet
**When** I access features

- Firefox (latest 2 versions)
- Safari (latest 2 versions)
- Edge (latest 2 versions)

**Given** I use an older browser
**When** I access the app
**Then** I should see:
- Graceful degradation (core functionality works)
- Polyfills for missing features
- Browser compatibility message (if too old)

**Given** I use Safari
**When** I access the app

- Have all my prompts deleted (cascade delete)
- Have my data removed from Firestore
- Have my Firebase Auth account deleted

**Given** prompts are shared
**When** accessed via UUID

- Access metrics dashboards (Grafana)
- Query logs efficiently (structured JSON)

---

### NFR-8: Scalability
**Priority:** Should Have

#### Acceptance Criteria

- Maintain performance (2-10 pods)
- Handle 1000+ concurrent users
- Queue requests if needed
- Return cached results when possible

**Given** load increases
**When** traffic spikes
**Then** Kubernetes should:
- Auto-scale pods (HPA: CPU >70%)
- Maintain availability
- Load balance across pods
- Gracefully handle pod restarts

**Given** the database grows
**When** prompt count increases
**Then** Firestore should:
- Index queries efficiently
- Paginate results
- Limit per-user queries (last 10)
- Archive old prompts (optional future feature)
