/**
 * Regression: session titles must not truncate mid-phrase at exactly 2 words,
 * and disambiguator suffixes must not echo words already in the base title.
 *
 * Invariants:
 *  (a) For any input with N>2 meaningful words, deriveBaseTitle may include
 *      up to MAX_TITLE_TOKENS words constrained by MAX_TITLE_CHARS — never
 *      exactly the first 2 tokens regardless of content.
 *  (b) extractDisambiguator(input, excludeTokens) MUST NOT return a token
 *      that already appears in excludeTokens (case-insensitive), otherwise
 *      the composed title becomes an echo like "Cinematic Aerial - aerial".
 *
 * Bugs captured:
 *  - "astronaut on mars at sunset" rendered as "Astronaut On" (truncated
 *    at 2 words, cut mid-phrase).
 *  - "Cinematic aerial shot..." rendered as "Cinematic Aerial - aerial"
 *    (disambiguator duplicated a word already in the title).
