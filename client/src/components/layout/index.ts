/**
 * Layout Components (Radix UI Themes inspired)
 * 
 * Layout components are used to separate layout responsibilities from content
 * and interactivity. This is the separation of concerns that makes your app
 * maintainable and easy to reason about.
 * 
 * Components:
 * - Box: Most fundamental layout component
 * - Flex: Organizes items along an axis using flexbox
 * - Grid: Organizes content in columns and rows
 * - Container: Provides consistent max-width
 * - Section: Provides consistent vertical spacing
 * 
 * Based on: https://www.radix-ui.com/themes/docs/overview/layout
