## How It Works (30 Seconds)

```
1. Write or paste your prompt
        ↓
2. Every phrase gets labeled automatically
   (subject, camera, lighting, action, style...)
        ↓
3. See 15+ color-coded highlights appear
        ↓
4. Click ANY highlight → get 5 AI alternatives
        ↓
5. One-click replace → prompt updates instantly
        ↓
6. Repeat until perfect
```

**This is NOT paste-and-optimize.** This is iterative, interactive refinement where you control every word.

## What Makes This Different

| Traditional Prompt Tools | PromptCanvas |
|--------------------------|--------------|
| Paste prompt → get output | Interactive editing canvas |
| One-shot optimization | Click-to-refine any phrase |
| Generic text improvement | 9 semantic categories for video (subject, camera, lighting...) |
| No feedback on structure | See exactly what elements your prompt contains |
| Wait for full response | Sub-300ms draft, then progressive refinement |

**The core insight:** AI video prompts aren't monolithic text—they're composed of distinct elements (subject, action, camera, lighting, style). PromptCanvas lets you refine each element individually while maintaining consistency.

---

## The Product: PromptCanvas

PromptCanvas is a three-pane editing environment purpose-built for AI video prompts.

### Left Pane: Span Bento Grid

Visual overview of every detected element in your prompt:

- **Subject** (3 spans) - "woman in her 30s", "auburn hair", "white linen dress"
- **Action** (1 span) - "walks barefoot"
- **Location** (2 spans) - "pristine beach", "shoreline"
- **Lighting** (2 spans) - "golden hour", "backlight"
- **Camera** (1 span) - "lateral tracking shot"
- **Style** (1 span) - "Terrence Malick aesthetic"

Click any category to jump to those spans in the editor. See at a glance what's covered and what's missing.

### Center Pane: Interactive Editor

Your prompt with ML-powered highlighting:

- Every phrase is color-coded by semantic category
- **Click any highlight** → suggestions panel activates
- **Select any text manually** → get suggestions for that selection
- Full editing: type, delete, paste, undo/redo
- Typewriter animation shows optimization progress

### Right Pane: AI Suggestions

Context-aware alternatives for the selected text:

- 3-5 suggestions that match the semantic category
- Understand surrounding context (what comes before/after)
- Respect edit history (maintain consistency with previous changes)
- One-click replacement
- Custom request: "make it more mysterious" → get tailored suggestions

### The Click-to-Enhance Flow

```
1. You click "woman in her 30s" (highlighted as Subject)
        ↓
2. System knows:
   - Category: subject.identity
   - Context before: "Wide shot:"
   - Context after: "walks barefoot along..."
   - Your previous edits in this session
        ↓
3. AI generates category-aligned alternatives:
   • "elderly man with weathered features"
   • "young dancer in flowing silk"
   • "shadowy figure in a dark coat"
   • "child clutching a red balloon"
   • "couple walking hand-in-hand"
        ↓
4. You click one → text replaces instantly
        ↓
5. Highlights update, suggestions panel ready for next edit
```

## Supporting Features

### Video Concept Builder

Don't know where to start? The guided wizard builds prompts element-by-element:

1. **Subject** → "Who or what is in the scene?"
2. **Action** → "What are they doing?"
3. **Location** → "Where does this take place?"
4. **Camera** → "How should this be shot?"
5. **Lighting** → "What's the lighting like?"
6. **Style** → "What's the visual aesthetic?"

Each step provides AI suggestions. Conflict detection warns you if elements don't work together ("person under a tree" + "open wheat field" = conflict).

### Two-Stage Optimization

Speed + quality:

- **Stage 1 (~300ms):** Fast draft via Groq (Llama 3.1 8B)
- **Stage 1.5 (parallel):** Span labeling runs simultaneously
- **Stage 2 (~2s):** Quality refinement via OpenAI (GPT-4o-mini)

You see results in under a second. Refinement happens in the background.

### Semantic Taxonomy

9 parent categories, 30+ attributes, built specifically for video:

| Category | What It Covers |
|----------|----------------|
| **Shot** | Framing: wide shot, close-up, bird's eye |
| **Subject** | Identity, appearance, wardrobe, emotion |
| **Action** | Movement, state, gestures |
| **Environment** | Location, weather, context |
| **Lighting** | Source, quality, time of day |
| **Camera** | Movement, lens, angle |
| **Style** | Aesthetic, film stock |
| **Technical** | Aspect ratio, FPS, resolution, duration |
| **Audio** | Score, sound effects |

This taxonomy is the backbone of span labeling. When you click "golden hour," the system knows it's `lighting.timeOfDay` and generates lighting-appropriate alternatives.

### History & Sharing

- Auto-save up to 100 prompts per user
- Search and filter your history
- Share via UUID link (anyone can view)
- Export as TXT, Markdown, or JSON

## The Technical Edge

### Why This Is Hard to Replicate

1. **Domain-specific taxonomy** - 30+ semantic categories tuned for video, not generic NLP
2. **Context-aware suggestions** - Understands before/after text, edit history, category alignment
3. **Two-stage pipeline** - Sub-second perceived latency with background quality refinement
4. **Multi-provider LLM routing** - Automatic fallback, circuit breakers, operation-based routing
5. **Performance optimized** - 80%+ cache hit rate, request batching, parallel span labeling

## Example: Before & After

### Input
```
"cyberpunk street scene"
```

### PromptCanvas Output (with detected elements)

```
[Shot: Wide establishing shot]: A rain-slicked neon-lit street in a
towering cyberpunk metropolis at night, [Subject: holographic advertisements]
flicker across glass skyscrapers as [Subject: crowds of people in luminous
clothing] navigate between [Environment: food stalls emitting colorful steam].

[Camera: Slow descending crane shot] starting 50 feet high, gradually
lowering to street level over 8 seconds. Camera moves forward through
the crowd at walking pace. [Camera: Smooth gimbal movement] with slight
handheld micro-vibrations for realism.

[Lighting: Dominant cyan and magenta neon lighting] from storefronts
and holograms. [Lighting: Warm amber pools of light] from street vendors.
Overhead cool blue-white lights create dramatic shadows. Light
reflects off wet pavement creating mirror-like reflections.

[Style: Blade Runner-inspired cyberpunk aesthetic]. Shot on Arri Alexa
with [Camera: anamorphic lens] creating characteristic horizontal flares.
[Style: Color grading]: deep shadows, vibrant neons, desaturated mid-tones.
Film grain texture overlay.

[Technical: 24fps] for cinematic feel, [Technical: 2.39:1 aspect ratio],
shallow depth of field (f/2.8).
```

## The Bottom Line

PromptCanvas is not another "make my prompt better" tool. It's an **interactive editing environment** that:

1. **Shows you** what elements your prompt contains (semantic labeling)
2. **Lets you refine** each element individually (click-to-enhance)
3. **Maintains consistency** across your edits (context awareness)
4. **Specializes in video** (30+ video-specific categories)

**Try it:** Write a simple prompt, see it labeled, click a highlight, pick a suggestion. That's the experience.
