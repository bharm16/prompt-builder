## The Problem

Video generation is expensive. One Sora generation costs real money. One Veo render burns real credits.

And you won't know if your prompt works until it's done rendering.

So you generate. Wait. Hate it. Tweak. Generate again. Wait again. Hate it again.

By the time you get what you wanted, you've burned through half your credits on bad takes.

## The Solution

**Draft cheap. Render perfect.**

Vidra lets you preview your video with fast, inexpensive models before committing to final generation:

| Stage | Model | Credit cost | Time | Purpose |
|-------|-------|-------------|------|--------|
| **Image Preview** | Flux Schnell | 1 credit / image | 5-10s | Validate framing, lighting, mood |
| **Video Preview** | Wan 2.2 | 28 credits (8s) | 30-60s | Test motion, pacing, camera |
| **Final Generation** | Sora 2, Veo 3, Kling, Luma | 48-192 credits (8s) | 2-5min | Production-ready output |

**The workflow:**
1. **Write** → Interactive editor with semantic highlighting
2. **Preview** → Fast drafts with Flux/Wan to validate direction  
3. **Refine** → Click any highlighted phrase for AI-powered alternatives
4. **Generate** → Final video with Sora, Veo, Kling, or Luma

**Result:** 5 preview iterations + 1 final generation beats 5 blind generation attempts. Same output, 70% fewer credits.

## What This Is

<!-- TODO: Add GIF showing the click-to-enhance flow -->

**Vidra is NOT another paste-and-optimize tool.**

It's an interactive editing canvas where:

1. You write/paste a prompt
2. Every phrase gets ML-labeled (subject, camera, lighting, action, style...)
3. 15+ color-coded highlights appear
4. **Click ANY highlight** → get 5 AI-generated alternatives
5. One-click replace → prompt updates
6. **Visual preview** → See your prompt as an image (auto-generated with Flux Schnell)
7. Repeat until perfect

**You control every word. The AI assists, you decide.**

## Key Features

| Feature | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Semantic Labeling** | 30+ categories tuned for video (subject, camera, lighting, action, style...) |
| **Click-to-Enhance** | Click any highlight → get context-aware alternatives → one-click replace |
| **Direct Video Generation** | Generate actual videos using OpenAI Sora 2, Google Veo 4, Runway Gen-45, Luma Ray 3, and Kling |
| **Visual Preview** | Auto-generates preview images using Flux Schnell as you type (debounced) |
| **Two-Stage Speed** | Sub-300ms draft (Groq) + background refinement (OpenAI) |
| **Video Concept Builder** | Guided wizard: subject → action → location → camera → lighting → style |
| **Consistency Tracking** | Suggestions respect your edit history to maintain coherence |
| **Integrated Asset System** | Create and reuse **characters, styles, locations, and objects** directly inside the prompt optimizer for consistent production output |
| **`@trigger` Prompt Assembly** | Reference assets via `@trigger` tokens with UX support (autocomplete/detection) so prompt building becomes reusable “building blocks” |
| **Reference Image Library** | Upload/manage reference images (standalone + asset-attached) to support identity + visual continuity |
| **Keyframe / Image-to-Video Workflow** | Use a start frame/keyframe (from uploads, library, or assets) to guide generation instead of text-only video |

## Why This Exists

AI video models (Sora, Runway, Veo3) are sensitive to prompt quality. The difference between:

❌ `"person on beach"`  
✅ `"Wide shot: woman in her 30s walks barefoot along pristine beach at golden hour, lateral tracking shot, warm backlight..."`

...is the difference between generic output and cinematic results.

**The problem:** Most people don't know cinematographic language.

**The solution:** Vidra shows you what elements your prompt has, what's missing, and lets you refine each element with AI assistance.

---

## Supported Ecosystem

Vidra is designed to be the all-in-one studio for the AI video ecosystem. It optimizes prompts AND directly generates video with:

*   **OpenAI Sora 2** (Physics simulation & continuity)
*   **Google Veo 4** (Cinematic lighting & atmosphere)
*   **Runway Gen-45** (Stylized visuals & VFX)
*   **Kling 2.6** (Character performance)
*   **Luma Ray 3** (Morphing & transitions)
*   **Wan 2.2** (High-fidelity previews)

---

## Strategic Value

### For Creative Agencies
*   **Standardize Quality:** Ensure every prompt sent to production meets a baseline of cinematographic detail.
*   **Asset Management:** Save, search, and share successful prompt patterns across the team.
*   **Client Alignment:** Use the visual preview to align with clients on style/mood before generating expensive video assets.

### For Marketing Teams
*   **Speed to Market:** Reduce the "prompt engineering" learning curve for social media managers and content creators.
*   **Consistency:** Maintain brand aesthetics by reusing specific Style and Lighting tokens.
