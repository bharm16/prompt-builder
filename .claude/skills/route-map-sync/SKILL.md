# Route Map Sync

This codebase has FOUR places that document HTTP routes:

1. `docs/architecture/ROUTE_MAP.md` — auto-generated, source of truth for the agent context layer
2. `CLAUDE.md` § "Route → Service → Client API Map" — hand-curated table
3. `AGENTS.md` § "References" — points to ROUTE_MAP.md
4. `GEMINI.md` and `server/GEMINI.md` and `server/CLAUDE.md` — additional curated tables

When a route is added, renamed, or removed, all four can drift. This skill enforces consistency.

## When to invoke

- After creating, renaming, or deleting any `*.routes.ts` file in `server/src/routes/`
- After changing any route path inside an existing routes file
- Before merging a PR that touches `server/src/routes/`

## Workflow

### 1. Detect changed routes

```bash
git diff --name-only HEAD -- 'server/src/routes/**/*.ts'
```

If no files in `server/src/routes/` changed, no sync is needed.

### 2. Run the route map check

```bash
npm run routemap:check
```

This compares the actual routes registered in the Express app against `docs/architecture/ROUTE_MAP.md`. It exits non-zero if they diverge.

### 3. Regenerate if needed

```bash
npm run routemap:generate
```

This rewrites `docs/architecture/ROUTE_MAP.md` based on the current routes.

### 4. Manually audit hand-curated tables

The script does NOT update tables embedded in `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `server/CLAUDE.md`, or `server/GEMINI.md`. After regenerating ROUTE_MAP.md, scan for the route in those files and update by hand.

For each newly added/changed/removed route, locate the row in:

- `CLAUDE.md` § "Route → Service → Client API Map"
- `GEMINI.md` § "Route → Service → Client API Map"
- `server/CLAUDE.md` (if present)
- `server/GEMINI.md` § "Route → Client API Map"
- `AGENTS.md` (currently delegates to ROUTE_MAP.md — verify reference is still accurate)

Each row should have: route, server route file, client API file. Use the format already in the table.

### 5. Verify client API client exists or is being added

If the route is new, confirm there's a corresponding client API file at one of:

- `client/src/api/<name>Api.ts` — thin fetch wrapper
- `client/src/services/<Name>Api.ts` — stateful client
- `client/src/features/<feature>/api/` — feature-scoped

If not, this is a cross-layer change — invoke `.claude/skills/cross-layer-change/SKILL.md`.

### 6. Run validation

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
npm run lint
```

### 7. Commit

Route file change + ROUTE_MAP.md regen + hand-edited tables should ALL be in the same commit. They're one logical change.

## Common pitfalls

- **Forgetting hand-curated tables**: The script only updates `ROUTE_MAP.md`. The four other context files require manual edits.
- **Adding a route without a client API file**: Routes without clients become dead ends — check immediately whether the client side is also being added.
- **Generic DTOs vs UI-shaped DTOs**: Route responses should be general-purpose, not tailored to a single UI component. See server/CLAUDE.md § "Frontend-Backend Boundary".
