# Context-Aware Phrase Extraction - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive context-aware system that intelligently maps Creative Brainstorm data to phrase highlighting in the Prompt Editor. This creates a seamless, intelligent workflow where user input directly influences how the optimized prompt is analyzed and highlighted.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. PromptContext Utility Class (`client/src/utils/PromptContext.js`)

A robust context management system that:

- **Stores structured brainstorm data**: subject, action, location, time, mood, style, event
- **Builds intelligent keyword maps**: Automatically extracts variations, plurals, and word combinations
- **Creates semantic expansions**: Maps related terms (e.g., "golden hour" → "magic hour", "warm light", "sunset")
- **Provides category matching**: Identifies which category a phrase belongs to based on user input
- **Supports serialization**: Can be stored and restored from JSON for persistence

**Key Features:**
```javascript
const context = new PromptContext({
  subject: 'lone astronaut',
  action: 'walking slowly',
  location: 'abandoned space station',
  time: 'golden hour'
});

// Automatically generates:
// - Keywords: ['lone astronaut', 'astronaut', 'lone']
// - Semantic matches: ['golden hour', 'magic hour', 'warm light']
// - Category mappings for intelligent highlighting
```

### 2. Enhanced Phrase Extractor (`client/src/features/prompt-optimizer/phraseExtractor.js`)

Completely refactored the phrase extraction system with three-tier prioritization:

**Priority 1: User-Provided Elements** (Confidence: 1.0)
- Directly matches phrases from Creative Brainstorm
- Highest priority in highlighting
- Tagged with `source: 'user-input'`

**Priority 2: Semantic Matches** (Confidence: 0.8)
- Finds related terms using semantic expansion
- Examples: "panning" matches "camera pans", "sunset" matches "golden hour"
- Tagged with `source: 'semantic-match'`

**Priority 3: NLP Extraction** (Confidence: 0.6-0.7)
- Fallback to compromise.js for remaining phrases
- Extracts descriptive phrases, camera movements, technical specs
- Tagged with `source: 'nlp-extracted'`

**Intelligent Features:**
- Smart deduplication (keeps highest-priority phrases)
- Limits to top 15 highlights to avoid clutter
- Scoring system prioritizes:
  - User input (100+ points)
  - Semantic matches (80+ points)
  - Technical specs (50+ points)
  - Longer, more specific phrases (up to 40 points)

### 3. Data Flow Integration

**Creative Brainstorm → PromptOptimizerContainer:**
- Modified `handleConceptComplete()` to create `PromptContext` instance
- Stores context in component state
- Passes context through entire optimization pipeline

**PromptOptimizerContainer → PromptCanvas:**
- Added `promptContext` prop to PromptCanvas
- Context flows through to phrase extraction

**PromptCanvas → Phrase Highlighting:**
- Updated `formatTextToHTML()` to accept context parameter
- Passes context to `extractVideoPromptPhrases()`
- Memoizes with context dependency

### 4. Visual Feedback (`client/src/features/prompt-optimizer/PromptCanvas.jsx`)

Added context-aware badge to CategoryLegend:

```jsx
{hasContext && (
  <div className="...emerald badge...">
    <CheckIcon />
    <span>Brainstorm Context Active</span>
  </div>
)}
```

**UX Benefits:**
- Users see when their Creative Brainstorm data is being used
- Clear visual feedback that context influences highlighting
- Builds trust in the intelligent system

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suites with **48 passing tests**:

### PromptContext Tests (27 tests)
- Constructor and initialization
- Keyword map building
- Semantic group generation
- Category matching (exact, partial, semantic)
- Variation generation (plurals, participles, articles)
- Color assignment
- Serialization/deserialization
- Edge cases

### Phrase Extractor Tests (21 tests)
- Extraction without context (baseline behavior)
- Context-aware extraction (user input, semantic matches)
- Prioritization and scoring
- Deduplication
- Edge cases (null context, empty data, special characters)
- Metadata validation

**Test Results:**
```bash
✓ 27 PromptContext tests - all passing
✓ 21 phraseExtractor tests - all passing
✓ Build successful
✓ No syntax errors
```

## How It Works - User Flow

### Step 1: Creative Brainstorm
User fills out form:
```
Subject: lone astronaut
Action: walking slowly
Location: abandoned space station
Time: golden hour
Style: 35mm film
```

### Step 2: Optimization
Click "Generate" → Context created:
```javascript
{
  elements: {
    subject: 'lone astronaut',
    action: 'walking slowly',
    // ... etc
  },
  keywordMaps: {
    subject: ['lone astronaut', 'astronaut', 'lone'],
    // ... etc
  },
  semanticGroups: {
    lightingQuality: ['golden hour', 'magic hour', 'warm light']
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Prompt Editor
AI generates optimized text:
> "A lone astronaut walks slowly through an abandoned space station bathed in warm golden hour light. Shot on 35mm film with cinematic framing..."

### Step 4: Intelligent Highlighting

**User-provided terms (highest priority):**
- ✅ "lone astronaut" (exact match from subject)
- ✅ "abandoned space station" (exact match from location)
- ✅ "golden hour" (exact match from time)

**Semantic matches:**
- ✅ "warm light" (semantic match to "golden hour")
- ✅ "walking" (variation of "walking slowly")

**NLP-extracted:**
- ✅ "35mm film" (technical spec)
- ✅ "cinematic framing" (descriptive phrase)

**Result:** Top 10-15 most relevant phrases highlighted, with user input prioritized!

## Benefits

### 1. **Intelligent Context Awareness**
- System "remembers" what the user cared about in brainstorming
- Prioritizes highlighting those exact elements
- Catches paraphrases and variations automatically

### 2. **Reduced Cognitive Load**
- Users don't get overwhelmed with 50+ highlights
- Most important phrases (their own input) are always highlighted
- Clear visual feedback via badge

### 3. **Semantic Understanding**
- Recognizes "sunset" and "golden hour" are related
- Matches "panning" with user's "camera pans" input
- Understands verb variations (walk, walking, walks)

### 4. **Backwards Compatible**
- Works perfectly without context (falls back to NLP)
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Optional enhancement that activates when context is available

### 5. **Extensible Architecture**
- Easy to add new semantic mappings
- Scoring system can be tuned
- Can persist context for future sessions

## Technical Highlights

### Performance Optimizations
- Memoized phrase extraction with `useMemo()`
- Caches extraction results internally
- Lazy loads NLP library
- Smart deduplication prevents wasted processing

### Code Quality
- **255 lines** of well-documented PromptContext code
- **254 lines** of enhanced phrase extractor
- **350+ lines** of comprehensive tests
- JSDoc comments throughout
- No lint errors, valid syntax

### Robustness
- Handles null/undefined gracefully
- Works with partial context data
- Case-insensitive matching
- Regex escaping prevents injection
- Type-safe color assignments

## Future Enhancements

### 1. User Feedback Learning
Track which suggestions users accept/reject:
```javascript
class FeedbackCollector {
  recordSuggestionUsage(suggestion, action) {
    // Store: accepted, rejected, modified
    // Improve future suggestions based on patterns
  }
}
```

### 2. Visual Mapping Component
Show how input → output:
```jsx
<InputMappingVisualization
  originalInputs={brainstormData}
  mappedPhrases={phrases}
/>
// Shows: "golden hour" → ["golden hour", "warm light", "sunset"]
```

### 3. Confidence Threshold Controls
Let users adjust sensitivity:
```jsx
<Slider
  label="Semantic Matching Sensitivity"
  min={0.5}
  max={1.0}
  onChange={setConfidenceThreshold}
/>
```

### 4. Category-Specific Extractors
More specialized patterns:
```javascript
const cameraExtractor = {
  patterns: [/\b(dolly|pan|tilt|zoom|track)\w*\b/gi],
  contextAware: true
}
```

### 5. Persistent Context
Save context with prompts:
```javascript
// Store in Firebase with prompt
{
  uuid: 'abc123',
  prompt: '...',
  context: contextInstance.toJSON(),
  timestamp: Date.now()
}
```
