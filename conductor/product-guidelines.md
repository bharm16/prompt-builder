# Product Guidelines: Vidra

## 1. Voice and Tone
*   **Professional & Tool-like:** Communication should be precise, efficient, and clear. Avoid overly flowery or marketing-heavy language.
*   **Expert Vocabulary:** Use industry-standard cinematographic terminology (e.g., "Lateral Tracking," "Anamorphic Lens," "Chiaroscuro") to respect the professional expertise of the users.
*   **Direct & Actionable:** Error messages and guidance should state the issue clearly and provide immediate steps for resolution.

## 2. Interaction Principles
*   **Collaborative Pilot:** The AI is a co-pilot, not an autopilot. Every change to the prompt must be initiated by the user. The AI provides structured alternatives, but the user makes the final decision.
*   **Low-Latency Feedback:** The system must prioritize immediate visual and semantic feedback. As a user types, labels should update, and draft images should refresh to maintain a tight creative loop.
*   **Predictable Workflows:** Moving from "Draft" to "Production" should be a clear, multi-shot process where the user feels in control of their credit spend at every step.

## 3. Visual & UI Guidelines
*   **Semantic Clarity:** Use consistent, high-contrast color coding for semantic spans (e.g., Camera = Blue, Lighting = Yellow, Subject = Purple) to help users "read" their prompt structure at a glance.
*   **Impact Previews:** Display generated images prominently and early. The visual preview is the primary validator for the text prompt.
*   **Explicit Quality Tiers:** Visually distinguish between "Draft" previews (e.g., using lower resolution or specific "Draft" badges) and "Production" masters to manage quality expectations.
*   **Functional Density:** The interface should feel like a high-performance workstation. Prioritize the main editing canvas and use collapsible panels for secondary information like history or advanced settings.

## 4. AI & Suggestion Guidelines
*   **Contextual Diversity:** When offering suggestions (e.g., for "Subject"), provide a diverse range of 5 options that explore different facets of the category while respecting the surrounding context of the prompt.
*   **Non-Destructive Editing:** All AI-driven changes should be easily reversible. Maintain a clear history of prompt versions.
