🔍 WORST PERFORMERS (for debugging):
  [13/25] "tree being cut down by lumberjack"
    Notes: The extraction missed several important visual elements, such as 'weathered hands' and 'powerful swing'. There were also several false positives, particularly with non-visual elements being extracted. Taxonomy errors were present, especially with misclassification of 'tree' and 'leaves'. Technical specs were mostly covered, but some audio elements were missed.

    Notes: The extraction missed several important elements, particularly in lighting and style. There were multiple false positives, especially with non-visual elements being extracted. Taxonomy errors were present, notably in the misclassification of vibrant paint palette and lighting. Granularity issues were minor but present in some spans.
  [15/25] "cat chasing a mouse"
    Notes: The extraction missed several important elements, especially in audio and style. There were duplicate and non-visual extractions, affecting precision. Taxonomy errors were present in style classification.
