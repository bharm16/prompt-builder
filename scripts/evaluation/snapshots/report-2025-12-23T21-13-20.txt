⏱️  LATENCY STATS (ms):
  Avg: 8169 | P50: 7654 | P95: 11555 | P99: 11555

MISSED ELEMENTS BY SEVERITY (Examples):
  IMPORTANT: red collar (subject), low angle (camera), soft shadows and highlights (lighting), static tripod (camera), muffled game sounds and clicking (audio)
  MINOR: minimal motion blur (style), consistent framing and subject continuity (style), chiaroscuro effect (lighting)

📉 MISSED ELEMENTS BY CATEGORY (Count):
  - camera: 4
  - lighting: 4
  - subject: 2
  - style: 2
  - audio: 1

CATEGORY SCORES (avg coverage/precision):
  shot         4.67 / 4.67
  subject      4.00 / 4.33
  action       3.67 / 4.67
  environment  4.67 / 5.00
  lighting     3.67 / 3.67

  style        4.00 / 4.00
  technical    4.67 / 4.67
  audio        3.33 / 3.67

FALSE POSITIVE REASONS:
  - abstract_concept: 3
      e.g.: Naturalistic, calm atmosphere, depth
  - non_visual: 2
      e.g.: fur, cozy evening atmosphere
  - duplicate: 3
      e.g.: warm sunlight, deep focus, deep focus
  - other: 1
      e.g.: f/11

TOP TAXONOMY ERRORS:
  - camera.movement → camera.angle (1x) (e.g. "Handheld low-angle, 50mm")
  - action.movement → action (1x) (e.g. "playing computer games with intense focus in a")
  - camera.focus → camera.lens (1x) (e.g. "deep focus, f/11")

📐 GRANULARITY ISSUES:
  - too_coarse: 3x (e.g., "running energetically through the park in a sunlit")

ERRORS BY SECTION:
  main            missed 11, falsePositives 5
  technicalSpecs  missed 2, falsePositives 2
  alternatives    missed 0, falsePositives 2

CONFIDENCE ERROR RATES:
  high   3.4% (2/59)
    Failures: "deep focus" (shot.type), "deep focus" (shot.type)
  medium 13.8% (4/29)
    Failures: "warm sunlight" (style.colorGrade), "Naturalistic" (lighting.quality), "calm atmosphere" (audio.ambient)
  low    17.6% (3/17)
    Failures: "depth" (camera.focus), "fur" (subject.identity), "f/11" (technical.frameRate)
  Notes: No clear confidence threshold recommendation.

🔍 WORST PERFORMERS (for debugging):
  [18/25] "cat laying in the sun through a window"
    Notes: The extraction was generally good but missed some important visual elements like 'static tripod' and 'soft highlights'. There were also some false positives, particularly with non-visual elements and duplicates. Taxonomy errors were present, especially in the classification of 'deep focus, f/11'. Granularity was mostly correct, but there was a notable error with 'deep focus, f/11' being too coarse.
  [20/25] "dog running in a park"
    Notes: The extraction was generally good, but some important visual elements like 'red collar' and 'low angle' were missed. There were a few false positives related to abstract concepts and duplicates. Taxonomy was mostly correct, with a minor error in camera angle classification. Granularity was mostly appropriate, with one instance of a span being too coarse.
  [21/25] "man playing computer games"
    Notes: The extraction was generally good, with some minor issues in coverage and taxonomy. The technical specs were well captured, but some audio and camera elements were missed. Precision was slightly affected by the inclusion of abstract concepts.
