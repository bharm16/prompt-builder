    Failures: "handheld tracking" (audio.ambient), "window" (lighting.source), "Soft daylight from window" (lighting.quality)
  Notes: No clear confidence threshold recommendation.

🔍 WORST PERFORMERS (for debugging):
  [18/25] "storyboard with sketches panning from left to right"
    Notes: The extraction missed several important visual elements related to the storyboard and its context. Some spans were incorrectly classified as abstract concepts, and there were taxonomy errors in the roles assigned to certain spans.
  [18/25] "a large box, exploding outward with full bedroom decor, at in the middle of an empty bedroom, commercial style, during ad for a home decor stoor featuring chic modern furniture bursting out"
    Notes: The extraction covers many elements but misses some important visual control points and has some misclassifications and boundary issues.
  [18/25] "young botanist with vibrant green gloves, gathering fallen leaves with a canvas bag, at sun-drenched botanical garden pathway"
    Notes: The extraction covers many elements but misses key actions and qualities. Some spans are too coarse, and there are duplicates and misclassifications.
