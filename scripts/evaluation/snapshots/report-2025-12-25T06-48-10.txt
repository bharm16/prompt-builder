🔍 WORST PERFORMERS (for debugging):
  [17/25] "man cooking a meal in a kitchen"
    Notes: The extraction missed some important elements like 'chef's knife' and 'soft, warm light'. There were false positives for non-visual elements like 'sizzling' and 'bubbling'. Taxonomy errors included misclassification of 'amber hue' and 'Over-the-shoulder, 50mm'. Granularity was generally good.
  [17/25] "gorilla drinking from a paper cup at a water cooler"
    Notes: The extraction missed several important visual elements, particularly related to the subject's appearance and lighting quality. Some non-visual elements were incorrectly extracted, affecting precision. Technical specs were mostly well-extracted, but there was a misclassification in camera roles.
  [18/25] "dog running up a hill"
    Notes: The extraction missed some important visual elements like 'golden fur' and 'bright eyes'. There were also some false positives, such as 'handheld tracking' being duplicated and 'Lit by warm backlighting' being misclassified. The technical specs were well covered, but there were some taxonomy errors and non-visual elements extracted.
