🔍 WORST PERFORMERS (for debugging):
  [18/25] "siberian husky with piercing blue eyes, sprinting across snowy field, at snowy mountain trail, during pausing dramatically, ears alert"
    Notes: The extraction missed several important visual elements related to lighting and style, and there were some taxonomy errors in the roles assigned to extracted spans.
  [20/25] "cat laying in the sun through a window"
    Notes: The extraction missed some important visual elements related to the subject's appearance and the quality of lighting. There were also some misclassifications in taxonomy, particularly with lighting and style roles.
  [21/25] "young dancer with colorful tattoos, spinning gracefully on one foot, at vibrant street mural alleyway"
    Notes: The extraction was mostly accurate, but some important visual elements were missed, particularly regarding the subject's appearance and specific lighting qualities. There were also some misclassifications in the audio and style categories.
