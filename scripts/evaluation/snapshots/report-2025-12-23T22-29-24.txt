TOP TAXONOMY ERRORS:
  - lighting.quality → style.aesthetic (12x) (e.g. "Naturalistic", "Naturalistic", "Kodachrome-inspired vibrant realism")
  - shot.type → camera.focus (7x) (e.g. "shallow focus", "deep focus", "deep focus")
  - shot.type → camera.movement (7x) (e.g. "handheld tracking", "handheld tracking", "slow-motion capture")
  - style.colorGrade → lighting.quality (4x) (e.g. "natural daylight", "dappled sunlight", "bright natural daylight")
  - subject.identity → subject.appearance (4x) (e.g. "colorful leaves", "fallen leaves", "leaves")

📐 GRANULARITY ISSUES:

ERRORS BY SECTION:
  main            missed 198, falsePositives 76
  technicalSpecs  missed 14, falsePositives 43
  alternatives    missed 0, falsePositives 37

CONFIDENCE ERROR RATES:
  high   1.6% (16/1000)

    Failures: "basketball" (subject.identity), "handheld tracking" (audio.ambient), "Different Lighting" (lighting.quality)
  Notes: No clear confidence threshold recommendation.

🔍 WORST PERFORMERS (for debugging):
  [14/25] "man playing computer games"
    Notes: The extraction missed several important elements related to style and camera movement. There were multiple false positives, especially with abstract concepts and non-visual elements. Taxonomy errors were present, particularly with camera roles. Granularity issues were noted in action spans.
  [17/25] "man jogging through a park"
    Notes: The extraction missed several important visual elements, such as 'jogging' and 'winding paths'. Some non-visual and abstract concepts were incorrectly extracted, affecting precision. Taxonomy errors were present, particularly in lighting and style roles. Technical specs were well-extracted.
  [17/25] "man riding a bike"
    Notes: The extraction captured most technical specs accurately but missed some important visual elements like 'black helmet' and 'lush greenery and flowers'. There were some false positives related to abstract concepts and non-visual elements. Granularity was mostly correct, but some spans were too coarse. Taxonomy errors were minimal, with one notable misclassification of 'natural daylight'.
