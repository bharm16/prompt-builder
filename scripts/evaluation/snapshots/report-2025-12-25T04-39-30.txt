🔍 WORST PERFORMERS (for debugging):
  [18/25] "man screaming in rain"
    Notes: The extraction covers many visual elements but misses some important aspects like lighting source and camera movement. There are some false positives and taxonomy errors, particularly with the classification of audio and style elements.
  [18/25] "storyboard with sketches panning from left to right"
    Notes: The extraction missed several important visual elements and included some abstract concepts that should not have been extracted. Taxonomy roles were also misclassified in some instances.
  [18/25] "a large box, exploding outward with full bedroom decor, at in the middle of an empty bedroom, commercial style, during ad for a home decor stoor featuring chic modern furniture bursting out"
    Notes: The extraction missed several important visual elements related to lighting and action states. There were also some false positives and taxonomy errors, particularly with the classification of decor and lighting elements.
