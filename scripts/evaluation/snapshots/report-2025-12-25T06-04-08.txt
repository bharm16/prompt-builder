  Recommended minConfidence: 0.80

🔍 WORST PERFORMERS (for debugging):
  [16/25] "man looking out of a window"
    Notes: The extraction missed some important elements like 'Terrence Malick film' and 'soft shadows'. There were several false positives related to 'window' being incorrectly labeled as a subject. Some taxonomy errors were present, such as 'static tripod' being misclassified. Technical specs were partially extracted, but some errors were noted, such as 'f/11' being incorrectly labeled as frame rate.
  [16/25] "man driving a car"
    Notes: The extraction missed several important visual elements, especially in the environment and lighting categories. There were also issues with taxonomy, particularly with 'deep focus' being misclassified. Some duplicates and non-visual elements were incorrectly extracted, affecting precision.
  [17/25] "man playing computer games"
    Notes: The extraction missed several important elements, particularly in style and audio categories. Some non-visual elements were incorrectly extracted, and there were a few taxonomy errors, especially in distinguishing between action and audio.
