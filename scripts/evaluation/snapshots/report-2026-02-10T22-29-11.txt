  Notes: No clear confidence threshold recommendation.

🔍 WORST PERFORMERS (for debugging):
  [22/25] "man cooking a meal in a kitchen"
    Notes: The extraction was mostly accurate, with a few minor issues. The 'chef's knife' was misclassified as 'subject.appearance' instead of 'subject.wardrobe'. The 'rolled-up shirt sleeves, wooden spoon' span was overly broad, combining wardrobe and object. The 'chef's focus and skill' was missed, which is important for capturing the subject's emotion.
  [23/25] "dog, barking, at home"
    Notes: The extraction was mostly accurate, with comprehensive coverage of the main and technical specs sections. However, it missed some elements in the alternative approaches section, such as 'low-angle shot' and 'golden hour lighting'. There was a duplicate extraction for lighting in the technical specs. Overall, the taxonomy and granularity were handled well.
