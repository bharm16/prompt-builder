🔍 WORST PERFORMERS (for debugging):
  [16/25] "dog catching a frisbee"
    Notes: The extraction missed some important elements like 'blue collar', 'static tripod', and 'motion blur minimal'. There were also some false positives and taxonomy errors, particularly in lighting and style categories. Technical specs were mostly well extracted.
  [17/25] "grizzled fisherman with a weather-beaten face, casting a line into choppy waves, at rundown wooden pier at sunrise"
    Notes: The extraction missed some important elements like the action of casting a line and audio details. Some non-visual elements were incorrectly extracted, and there were a few taxonomy errors. Technical specs were mostly well extracted.
  [18/25] "young botanist with vibrant green gloves, gathering fallen leaves with a canvas bag, at sun-drenched botanical garden pathway"
    Notes: The extraction missed some important elements like the action of gathering leaves and the playful shadows. There were also some false positives and taxonomy errors, particularly in subject and lighting categories. Technical specs were well extracted.
