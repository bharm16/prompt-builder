🔍 WORST PERFORMERS (for debugging):
  [18/25] "man looking out of a window"
    Notes: The extraction missed several important elements, particularly in the environment and style categories. There were also some taxonomy errors related to camera focus spans.
  [20/25] "cat laying in the sun through a window"
    Notes: The extraction missed several important visual control points, particularly related to actions and style. However, technical specs were well covered.
  [22/25] "young dancer with colorful tattoos, spinning gracefully on one foot, at vibrant street mural alleyway"
    Notes: The extraction is mostly accurate, but several important elements related to style and lighting were missed. Taxonomy roles were mostly correct, but some lighting elements were misclassified.
