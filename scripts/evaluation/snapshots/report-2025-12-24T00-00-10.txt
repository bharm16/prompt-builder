  Recommended minConfidence: 0.80

🔍 WORST PERFORMERS (for debugging):
  [17/25] "man playing computer games"
    Notes: The extraction missed several important elements related to style and audio. There were also some misclassifications, particularly with 'static tripod' and 'shallow focus'. Precision was affected by non-visual elements being extracted.
  [17/25] "man jogging through a park"
    Notes: The extraction missed several important visual elements, such as the subject's athletic build and the action of jogging. Some abstract concepts were incorrectly extracted, and there were a few taxonomy errors, particularly in lighting and style. Technical specs were well-covered.
  [17/25] "dog catching a ball mid air"
    Notes: The extraction missed some critical action and style elements, and there were a few taxonomy errors. Technical specs were well extracted, but some lighting and style elements were misclassified or missed.
