  [17/25] "dog looking through a window as the seasons change"
    Notes: The extraction missed several important visual elements, especially related to the subject's appearance and actions. Some abstract concepts were incorrectly extracted, and there were a few taxonomy errors, particularly with style elements.
  [17/25] "man looking through a window"
    Notes: The extraction missed some important elements like 'gazing silently' and 'soft rustle of leaves'. There were several false positives related to the 'window' being incorrectly labeled as a subject identity. Some taxonomy errors were present, particularly with camera movements and angles.
