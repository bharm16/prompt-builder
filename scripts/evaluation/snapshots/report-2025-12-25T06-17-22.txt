🔍 WORST PERFORMERS (for debugging):
  [13/25] "gorilla wearing white gloves tap dancing in train station"
    Notes: The extraction missed several important visual elements, such as 'shiny black fur' and 'reflective surfaces highlighting movement'. There were also several false positives, particularly with non-visual elements being extracted. Taxonomy errors were present, with incorrect roles assigned to some spans. Technical specs were mostly covered, but some roles were misclassified.
  [16/25] "siberian husky with piercing blue eyes, sprinting across snowy field, at snowy mountain trail, during pausing dramatically, ears alert"
    Notes: The extraction missed several important elements, especially in lighting and audio. There were also issues with duplicate and incorrect extractions, affecting precision. Taxonomy errors were present, particularly in camera roles.
  [16/25] "abraham lincoln"
    Notes: The extraction missed several elements from the alternative approaches, particularly related to shot types and lighting. Some non-visual elements were incorrectly extracted, and there were a few taxonomy errors, especially in distinguishing between camera and shot roles. Technical specs were partially covered but had some misclassifications.
