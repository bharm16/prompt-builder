  Avg: 11792 | P50: 12137 | P95: 12137 | P99: 12137

MISSED ELEMENTS BY SEVERITY (Examples):
  IMPORTANT: gazing out the window with curiosity (action), vibrant outdoor view (environment), static tripod (camera)
  MINOR: minimal motion blur (style), consistent framing and subject continuity (style)

📉 MISSED ELEMENTS BY CATEGORY (Count):
  - style: 2
  - action: 1
  - environment: 1
  - camera: 1

CATEGORY SCORES (avg coverage/precision):
  shot         5.00 / 5.00
  subject      4.00 / 5.00
  action       2.00 / 5.00
  environment  3.00 / 5.00
  lighting     5.00 / 5.00
  camera       4.00 / 5.00
  style        3.00 / 3.00
  technical    5.00 / 5.00
  audio        5.00 / 5.00

FALSE POSITIVE REASONS:
  - abstract_concept: 2
      e.g.: High-Angle Variation, Evening Light Variation

TOP TAXONOMY ERRORS:
  - shot.type → camera.angle (1x) (e.g. "eye-level shot")

📐 GRANULARITY ISSUES:
  - too_coarse: 1x (e.g., "soft tabby fur, bright green eyes")

ERRORS BY SECTION:
  main            missed 5, falsePositives 0
  technicalSpecs  missed 0, falsePositives 0
  alternatives    missed 0, falsePositives 2

CONFIDENCE ERROR RATES:
  high   0.0% (0/25)
  medium 33.3% (1/3)
    Failures: "High-Angle Variation" (style.aesthetic)
  low    14.3% (1/7)
    Failures: "Evening Light Variation" (style.aesthetic)
  Notes: No clear confidence threshold recommendation.

🔍 WORST PERFORMERS (for debugging):
  [0/25] "man cooking a meal in a kitchen"
    Notes: Judge failed: Judge response did not match expected schemas
  [20/25] "cat looking out of a window"
    Notes: The extraction was generally good, but missed some important visual elements like the cat's action and the vibrant outdoor view. There were a few false positives related to abstract concepts in alternative approaches. Granularity was mostly correct, but one span was too coarse. Taxonomy was mostly accurate, with a minor error in camera angle classification.
