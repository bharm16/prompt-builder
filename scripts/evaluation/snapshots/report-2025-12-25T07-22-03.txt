🔍 WORST PERFORMERS (for debugging):
  [14/25] "woman playing computer games"
    Notes: The extraction missed several important elements, particularly in subject and environment categories. There were also multiple taxonomy errors, especially with subject-related items being misclassified. Precision was low due to non-visual elements being extracted.
  [17/25] "dog looking out of a window"
    Notes: The extraction missed some important visual elements like the dog's appearance and style references. There were also some false positives related to abstract concepts and non-visual elements. Taxonomy errors were minimal, but there was a misclassification of 'gazing' as a movement instead of a gesture.
  [17/25] "man looking through a window"
    Notes: The extraction missed some important elements like 'gazing thoughtfully' and 'eye level'. There were also several false positives related to non-visual elements like 'wearing' and 'window'. Taxonomy errors were present, particularly with 'Naturalistic' being misclassified. Technical specs were mostly well-extracted, but some audio elements were missed.
