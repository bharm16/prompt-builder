TOP TAXONOMY ERRORS:
  - shot.type → camera.movement (3x) (e.g. "handheld from a low angle with shallow depth of field", "slow dolly in over-the-shoulder with shallow depth of field (f/1.8-f/2.8)", "tracking shot at eye level with selective focus (f/4-f/5.6)")
  - camera.lens → camera.movement (2x) (e.g. "static tripod at eye level with shallow depth of field (f/1.8-f/2.8)", "static tripod at eye level with shallow depth of field (f/1.8-f/2.8)")
  - subject.appearance → subject.appearance (1x) (e.g. "vibrant orange stripes, energetic movements")
  - camera.movement → camera (1x) (e.g. "static tripod at eye level with shallow depth of field (f/1.8-f/2.8)")
  - camera.movement → camera.angle (1x) (e.g. "tracking shot at eye level with selective focus (f/4-f/5.6)")

ERRORS BY SECTION:
  main            missed 3, falsePositives 0
  technicalSpecs  missed 148, falsePositives 0
  alternatives    missed 28, falsePositives 0

CONFIDENCE ERROR RATES:
  high   0.0% (0/160)
  medium 0.0% (0/0)
  low    0.0% (0/0)
  Notes: No false positives to analyze. No clear confidence threshold recommendation.

🔍 WORST PERFORMERS (for debugging):
  [13/25] "storyboard with sketches panning from left to right"
    Notes: The extraction missed several critical technical specifications and audio elements, leading to low coverage scores. Some elements were misclassified, affecting taxonomy scores.
  [14/25] "man jogging through a park"
    Notes: The extraction missed several critical technical specifications and audio elements, which are essential for a comprehensive understanding of the video prompt. The taxonomy role for the camera movement was incorrectly assigned, and the coverage for shot types was insufficient.
  [14/25] "man cooking a meal in a kitchen"
    Notes: The extraction missed several critical technical specifications and audio elements, which are essential for a comprehensive understanding of the video prompt. There was also a taxonomy error in classifying a camera movement as a shot type.
