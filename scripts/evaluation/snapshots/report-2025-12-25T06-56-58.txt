  - lighting.quality → style (7x) (e.g. "Naturalistic, warm", "naturalistic style", "Family drama")
  - technical.frameRate → camera.focus (5x) (e.g. "f/2.8", "f/11", "f/11")
  - shot.type → camera.movement (4x) (e.g. "handheld tracking", "handheld tracking", "handheld tracking")
  - action.movement → action.gesture (4x) (e.g. "showing", "joyfully riding", "energetic movements")

ERRORS BY SECTION:
  main            missed 135, falsePositives 27
  technicalSpecs  missed 24, falsePositives 37
  alternatives    missed 8, falsePositives 12

CONFIDENCE ERROR RATES:
  high   2.2% (23/1051)
    Failures: "Over-the-shoulder static shot, f/2.8" (camera.angle), "Eye-level static tripod, deep focus, f/11" (camera.angle), "6s" (technical.duration)
  medium 8.1% (33/408)
    Failures: "black gaming headset" (camera.lens), "grading" (action.movement), "window" (lighting.source)
  low    6.8% (19/281)
    Failures: "black game controller" (camera.lens), "seasonal decor" (audio.ambient), "jogging" (audio.ambient)
  Notes: No clear confidence threshold recommendation.

🔍 WORST PERFORMERS (for debugging):
  [17/25] "man riding a bike"
    Notes: The extraction missed several important visual elements, particularly in the action and audio categories. There were also some false positives and taxonomy errors, particularly with the classification of subjects and actions.
  [18/25] "woman playing computer games"
    Notes: The extraction missed some important elements related to action states and style. There were also some misclassifications regarding camera and action roles.
  [18/25] "man looking out of a window"
    Notes: The extraction missed several important visual control points, particularly in the action and environment categories. There were also some misclassifications in taxonomy and a false positive extraction.
