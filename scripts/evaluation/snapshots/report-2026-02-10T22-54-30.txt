FALSE POSITIVE REASONS:
  - duplicate: 1
      e.g.: Wide Shot

TOP TAXONOMY ERRORS:
  - camera.focus → camera.aperture (7x) (e.g. "f/1.8-f/2.8", "f/4-f/5.6", "f/4-f/5.6")
  - camera.focus → camera.focus (7x) (e.g. "shallow depth of field", "f/1.8-f/2.8", "deep focus")
  - camera.focus → technical.aperture (5x) (e.g. "shallow depth of field", "f/1.8-f/2.8", "f/4")
  - lighting.source → lighting.quality (4x) (e.g. "Daylight with tree-filtered shadows", "Warm sunlight from above, soft and natural", "soft key from an incandescent lamp, warm tones")
  - camera.focus → camera.lens (3x) (e.g. "f/4-f/5.6", "f/11-f/16", "f/2.8")

ERRORS BY SECTION:
  main            missed 37, falsePositives 0
  technicalSpecs  missed 12, falsePositives 0
  alternatives    missed 11, falsePositives 1

CONFIDENCE ERROR RATES:
  high   0.2% (1/479)
    Failures: "Wide Shot" (shot.type)
  medium 0.0% (0/0)
  low    0.0% (0/0)
  Notes: No clear confidence threshold recommendation.

🔍 WORST PERFORMERS (for debugging):
  [22/25] "man looking out of a window"
    Notes: The extraction is mostly accurate, but some important elements related to camera focus and lighting source were missed. Taxonomy roles were mostly correct, but there were some redundant entries for camera focus.
  [22/25] "man driving a car"
    Notes: The extraction was mostly accurate, but several important visual control points were missed, particularly in the action and environment categories. There were also some taxonomy errors related to the roles assigned to certain spans.
  [22/25] "man looking through a window"
    Notes: The extraction is mostly accurate but misses some important elements related to camera specifications and style mood. There are also some taxonomy errors in the extracted spans.
