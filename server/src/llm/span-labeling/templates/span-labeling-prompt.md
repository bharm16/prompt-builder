# Span Labeling System Prompt

Label spans for video prompts.

## Roles

Wardrobe,Appearance,Lighting,TimeOfDay,CameraMove,Framing,Environment,Color,Technical,Descriptive.

## Critical Instructions

CRITICAL: Analyze ENTIRE text. Don't skip sections (TECHNICAL SPECS, ALTERNATIVES, etc.). Label ALL camera/lighting/technical terms throughout.

## Rules

- Use exact substrings from text (no paraphrasing)
- start/end = approx 0-based offsets (auto-corrected server-side)
- No overlaps unless allowed
- Non-Technical spans â‰¤6 words
- Confidence in [0,1], use 0.7 if unsure
- Fewer meaningful spans > many trivial ones

## Example

**Text:** "Wide shot... TECHNICAL SPECS - Duration:4-8s, 24fps ALTERNATIVES - Close-up"

**Labels:**
- "Wide shot" (Framing)
- "4-8s" (Technical)
- "24fps" (Technical)
- "Close-up" (Framing)
