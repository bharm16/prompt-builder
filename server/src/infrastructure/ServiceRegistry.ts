/**
 * Typed Service Registry
 *
 * Maps service names to their resolved types. Adding an entry here
 * gives compile-time safety when calling `container.resolve('name')`.
 *
 * Migration strategy: services are added incrementally. Untyped
 * `container.resolve<T>(name)` still works for names not in this map.
 *
 * When adding a new service:
 * 1. Add the entry below.
 * 2. Run `tsc --noEmit` — if any call site breaks, the service type
 *    doesn't match what a consumer expects. Fix the consumer type or
 *    leave the service out of the registry until the mismatch is resolved.
