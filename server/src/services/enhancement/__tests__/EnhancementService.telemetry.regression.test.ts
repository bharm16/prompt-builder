/**
 * Invariant (cache-hit path): EnhancementService.getEnhancementSuggestions
 * MUST call trace.complete() exactly once with outcome="success" when a
 * cached result is returned. Without this, no `suggestions.completed`
 * PostHog event is emitted, silently breaking the T2V Optimize Health
 * dashboard.
 *
 * This guards the call site at the service (not the route — the route
 * forwards the trace; the service owns lifecycle).
 *
 * Coverage gap: the cache-miss success, validation-empty fallback, and
 * thrown-error terminal paths are NOT covered here because they require
 * driving the full pipeline (aiService.execute, validation, diversity,
 * category alignment) which is heavy to mock. Adding those cases is
 * tracked separately; if you delete a `trace.complete()` from one of
 * those paths this test will not catch it.
