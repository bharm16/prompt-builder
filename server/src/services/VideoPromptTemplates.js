Transform the following user concept into a production-ready AI video prompt (100-150 words).

User's concept: "${userConcept}"

**PROMPT:**

Write ONE descriptive paragraph following this precise structure:

 of performing in/at,, under, in a.

---

**GUIDING PRINCIPLES (in order of importance):**
1.  **Shot Type:** Start with the framing (e.g., wide shot, medium shot, close-up, extreme close-up). This establishes the entire scene's composition first.
2.  **Subject:** Clearly define the main subject. Include 2-3 specific, visible details (e.g., "a woman in a red trench coat with blonde hair") to ensure consistency and avoid generic outputs.
3.  **Action:** Describe ONE clear, specific, and physically plausible action. Multiple actions in one prompt severely degrade quality due to the architectural constraints of video models.
4.  **Setting:** Ground the action in a specific location and time (e.g., "a neon-lit Tokyo alley at midnight," "a serene beach at golden hour").
5.  **Camera:** Detail the camera's behavior. Specify both movement (e.g., static, slow dolly in, handheld tracking) and angle (e.g., low angle, high angle, eye-level).
6.  **Lighting:** Describe the light to control the mood. Specify its source (e.g., "soft window light"), direction (e.g., "from the left"), and quality (e.g., "creating deep shadows").
7.  **Style:** Provide a specific aesthetic reference. Avoid generic terms like "cinematic." Instead, use film stock ("shot on 35mm film"), genre ("film noir aesthetic"), or an artist/director reference ("in the style of Wes Anderson").

**WRITING RULES:**
✓ Total prompt length should be 100-150 words. Models follow concise, dense prompts more reliably.
✓ Use professional cinematic and photographic language (e.g., dolly, crane, rack focus, shallow DOF, f/1.8, Rembrandt lighting).
✓ The order of elements in the prompt paragraph dictates their priority in the AI's processing. Place the most important element FIRST.
✓ Describe only what the camera can SEE. Translate emotions and concepts into visible actions and environmental details.
✓ Be specific over generic: "a weathered oak desk" is superior to "a nice desk."

**AVOID:**
✗ Prompts longer than 150 words.
✗ Describing multiple simultaneous actions or a sequence of events. (Use multiple clips for a narrative.)
✗ Using ungrounded emotional adjectives (e.g., "a sad man").
✗ Using negative or instructive language (e.g., "don't show," "avoid," "no people"). Describe what you *want* to see instead.

**EXAMPLE STRUCTURED PROMPT:**
"Close-up of weathered, wrinkled hands slowly turning the pages of a large, leather-bound book on a dark oak desk. The camera slowly dollies back to reveal an elderly historian in a candlelit study. The scene is lit by a single, warm candle on the left, creating dramatic, low-key lighting with a high contrast ratio. The style is moody and atmospheric, shot on 35mm film with a shallow depth of field, f/1.8, creating significant bokeh in the background."

After the main prompt paragraph, add the following technical and creative specifications:

**TECHNICAL SPECS**
- **Duration:** 4-8s (Optimal for instruction-following and quality)
- **Aspect Ratio:** 16:9 (Landscape), 9:16 (Vertical), or 2.39:1 (Cinematic)
- **Frame Rate:** 24fps (Filmic) or 30fps (Standard Video)
- **Audio:**

**ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES (2 variations, 40-50 words each)**
Provide two brief, alternative prompts that explore different creative choices for the same core concept. This facilitates A/B testing and rapid iteration.
- **Variation 1 (Different Camera):** Explore a different camera angle or movement (e.g., "High-angle shot looking down...").
- **Variation 2 (Different Lighting/Mood):** Explore a different lighting setup or mood (e.g., "Bright, high-key lighting from a large window...").

---

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
Begin directly with the main prompt paragraph. Do not include any preamble, explanations, or conversational text.
