INSTRUCTIONS for Kling 2.1:
1. Use the structure: [Subject], [Subject Description], [Movement/Action], [Scene/Context], [Camera/Lighting].
2. Use strong, active verbs for motion (e.g., "sprinting", "gliding").
3. Include concrete physical appearance: facial details, clothing materials, body build, distinguishing features.
4. Specify camera movement clearly (e.g., "Wide aerial shot", "Low-angle tracking shot").
5. CHARACTER PERFORMANCE: Describe micro-expressions (eyes widening, lips curling), hand gestures, weight shifts, and breathing patterns. These are Kling's strength.
6. Do NOT include f-stop, aperture, ISO, or focal length specs — Kling ignores these. Spend those tokens on character detail instead.
7. VISUAL SPECIFICITY: Describe observable details — material textures, color temperatures, physical positions — not abstract moods or feelings.
8. Keep prompt length concise (40-80 words unless the user asked for more).
9. Do NOT use screenplay format. Use standard descriptive prose.
