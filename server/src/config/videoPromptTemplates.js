Step 1: Understand the element type and creative requirements
- Element: ${elementLabel}
- Current value: ${currentValue || 'Not set - starting fresh'}
- Mode: ${completionMode} ${isCompletion ? '(help complete this partial input)' : '(generate fresh suggestions)'}
- What makes this element type visually compelling?

Step 2: Analyze existing context at multiple levels
- Context: ${contextDisplay}
- Concept: ${concept || 'Building from scratch'}
- Immediate context: ${JSON.stringify(contextAnalysis.immediate)}
- Thematic elements: ${JSON.stringify(contextAnalysis.thematic)}
- Style patterns: ${JSON.stringify(contextAnalysis.stylistic)}
- Narrative structure: ${JSON.stringify(contextAnalysis.narrative)}

Step 3: Ensure contextual harmony
- Do suggestions complement existing elements?
- Is there thematic consistency with detected themes: ${contextAnalysis.thematic.themes.join(', ') || 'none'}?
- Do suggestions match the tone: ${contextAnalysis.thematic.tone}?
- Do suggestions avoid contradicting established context?

${isCompletion ? `- All 8 suggestions MUST start with or include: "${currentValue}"
- Add 2-3 relevant visual details that complete the element
- Maintain the user's intent while following video prompt guidelines
- Each completion should offer a different way to finish the element` : `- Generate 8 distinct, specific options
- Vary tone, style, intensity, and approach
- Each should offer a meaningfully different creative direction
- Ensure all are immediately usable and visually evocative`}
- Consider narrative elements: ${contextAnalysis.narrative.hasNarrative ? 'narrative flow important' : 'standalone elements'}

export const VIDEO_PROMPT_PRINCIPLES = `
**VIDEO PROMPT TEMPLATE PRINCIPLES (Use these as your baseline):**
These principles are from our production-ready video prompt template and should guide all suggestions:

1. **Specificity Over Generic**: "a weathered oak desk" is superior to "a nice desk"
   - Use concrete, visual details
   - Include 2-3 distinctive characteristics
   - Avoid vague adjectives

2. **Cinematic Language**: Use professional film terminology
   - Camera: dolly, crane, rack focus, shallow DOF, f/1.8
   - Lighting: Rembrandt lighting, 3:1 contrast, soft window light
   - Style: shot on 35mm film, film noir aesthetic, in the style of [director]

3. **One Main Action Rule**: Multiple actions severely degrade quality
   - Focus on ONE clear, specific, physically plausible action
   - "leaping over obstacles in slow motion" not "running, jumping, and spinning"

4. **Visual Precedence**: Describe only what the camera can SEE
   - Translate emotions into visible actions/environmental details
   - "elderly historian with trembling hands" not "a sad old person"

5. **Element Order = Priority**: First elements get processed first by AI
   - Most important visual element should come first
   - Shot type establishes composition
   - Subject defines focus
   - Action creates movement

6. **Duration Context**: Optimal clips are 4-8 seconds
   - Keep actions simple and clear
   - Avoid complex narratives (use multiple clips instead)

7. **Style References**: Avoid generic terms like "cinematic"
   - Use film stock: "shot on 35mm film", "Super 8 footage"
   - Use genre: "film noir aesthetic", "documentary realism"
   - Use director references: "in the style of Wes Anderson"
