# Codex Agent Guide (Vidra / PromptCanvas)

> **Sync note:** Canonical rules live in `CLAUDE.md`. This file adapts them for Codex.
> When updating shared rules, update `CLAUDE.md` first, then sync here.
> Do not replace existing `CLAUDE.md` / `GEMINI.md` files; use this as Codex-specific operating guidance.

## Non-Negotiable Rules

These constraints are absolute. No task justifies violating them.

- `client/src/` **NEVER** imports from `server/src/` — and vice versa
- No `container.resolve()` outside DI config files or route factory functions
- All LLM calls go through `aiService` — never call provider clients directly
- `continuitySessionService` may be `null` — always guard before access
- `fix:` commits must include a `*.regression.test.ts` — pre-commit hook enforces this
- Never mock the service being fixed in a regression test
- Never weaken an existing test to accommodate a fix
- Fixes should modify ≤5 files. If >5, stop and find the root cause fix
- Never combine dependency upgrades with code changes in the same commit
- Import only from canonical domain paths (`@services/enhancement/*`, not `@services/EnhancementService`)

## Project Snapshot

- Monorepo: Node.js 20+, ESM (`"type": "module"`).
- Client: React 18 + Vite + Tailwind + DaisyUI + Radix UI primitives.
- Server: Express + TypeScript (`tsx`) with LLM/Firebase/Stripe integrations.
- Shared imports: `#shared/*`.

## Domain Glossary

These terms have specific meanings in this codebase. Do not conflate them.

| Term | Meaning | Server Path | Route |
|------|---------|-------------|-------|
| **Span labeling** | ML categorization of prompt phrases into taxonomy categories (subject, camera, lighting…) for UI highlights | `server/src/llm/span-labeling/` | `/llm/label-spans` |
| **Enhancement / Suggestions** | AI-generated alternative phrases for a user-selected span (click-to-enhance) | `server/src/services/enhancement/` | `/api/suggestions`, `/api/enhance` |
| **Optimization** | Two-stage prompt rewriting pipeline (Groq fast draft → OpenAI refinement) | `server/src/services/prompt-optimization/` | `/api/optimize-stream` (SSE) |
| **Continuity** | Shot-to-shot visual consistency in multi-shot sequences (frame-bridge, style-match) | `server/src/services/continuity/` | `/api/continuity` |
| **Convergence** | Motion and visual convergence pipeline (iterative refinement toward target) | `server/src/services/convergence/` | `/api/motion` |
| **Video Concept** | Guided wizard flow: subject → action → location → camera → lighting → style | `server/src/services/video-concept/` | via `/api` routes |
| **Model Intelligence** | AI-powered model recommendation based on prompt analysis | `server/src/services/model-intelligence/` | `/api/model-intelligence` |
| **Preview** | Image (Flux Schnell) and video (Wan 2.2) draft generation before final render | `server/src/services/image-generation/`, `server/src/services/video-generation/` | `/api/preview` |
| **Generation** | Final video render via Sora, Veo, Kling, Luma, Runway | `server/src/services/video-generation/` | `/api/preview` (shared routes) |

See also: `docs/architecture/SERVICE_BOUNDARIES.md` for span-labeling vs. video-prompt-analysis boundary rules.

## Service Architecture

### DI Registration

Services are registered via domain-scoped files in `server/src/config/services/`:

| Registration File | Registers |
|---|---|
| `infrastructure.services.ts` | cache, metrics, Firebase clients, storage, assets, credits |
| `llm.services.ts` | aiService, claudeClient, groqClient, geminiClient |
| `enhancement.services.ts` | enhancementService, sceneDetection, coherence, videoPromptAnalysis |
| `generation.services.ts` | imageGeneration, videoGeneration, storyboardPreview, keyframe, faceSwap |
| `continuity.services.ts` | continuitySessionService (gated — see Feature Flags below) |
| `session.services.ts` | sessionService, modelIntelligence |

The container is created in `server/src/config/services.config.ts` and initialized in `services.initialize.ts`. Routes consume services via factory functions in `server/src/config/routes.config.ts`.

### Service Placement

- Single domain logic (e.g., new enhancement feature) → extend the domain service
- Cross-domain coordination (e.g., preview + optimization) → orchestrator in routes or new orchestration service
- Request/response shaping only → keep in route handler
- Shared utility (pure function, no dependencies) → `utils/`
- Never import a service from another domain directory for reuse — extract to shared or use route-level orchestration

### Frontend-Backend Decoupling

The client and server are **strictly decoupled**. Neither side may import from the other.

- The only shared code lives in `shared/` (types, constants, Zod schemas — never runtime logic).
- Changes to `shared/` are **contract changes** that affect both sides — run `tsc --noEmit` immediately after modifying.

**Anti-corruption layer:** Each client feature's `api/` directory insulates UI from server DTOs:

```
Server DTO → feature/api/schemas.ts (Zod) → feature/api/*.ts (transform) → hook → component
```

**Cross-layer change protocol:**

1. Update the `shared/` contract first.
2. Run `tsc --noEmit` — fix compilation errors on both sides.
3. Update the server route/service.
4. Update the client feature `api/` layer (schemas + transforms).
5. UI components should not need changes if the anti-corruption layer is working correctly.

## Feature Flags

| Flag | Default | Effect When Set |
|------|---------|----------------|
| `PROMPT_OUTPUT_ONLY=true` | `false` | Disables ALL preview, video generation, motion, and convergence routes. Video-related DI registrations still happen but routes are never mounted. |
| `ENABLE_CONVERGENCE=false` | `true` | Disables continuity service registration. `continuitySessionService` resolves to **`null`** from the DI container. |

**Rule:** Generation-related routes must be inside the `if (!promptOutputOnly)` block in `routes.config.ts`.

## Primary Workflows

### 1) Feature Workflow
1. Read relevant scope docs and impacted modules first (`client/`, `server/`, `shared/`).
2. Implement using established patterns:
   - Frontend: `client/src/components/VideoConceptBuilder/` style (orchestrator + hooks + api + components).
   - Backend: `server/src/services/prompt-optimization/` style (thin orchestrator + specialized services).
3. Add/update tests close to changed behavior.
4. Run targeted verification first, then full checks before handoff.

### 2) Bugfix Workflow

Read `.agents/skills/bugfix/SKILL.md` before every bugfix.

Key principle: invariant-first regression tests at the failure boundary. Never mock the service being fixed. The pre-commit hook rejects `fix:` commits without new test blocks.

### 3) Performance Workflow
1. Start app and verify baseline behavior.
2. Use highlight/perf scripts to measure before/after.
3. Change one variable at a time and keep a short measurement note.
4. Validate no regression in unit/e2e smoke tests.

### 4) Data Migration / Backfill Workflow
1. Run dry-run modes first where available.
2. Validate expected record count/sample output.
3. Execute real migration only after dry-run is clean.
4. Re-check key API paths and logs.

### 5) Integration Tests

Read `.agents/skills/integration-test/SKILL.md` before writing integration tests.

Key principle: write tests from contracts, not implementations. Default to fixing source code, not tests.

## Command Reference

## Commit Protocol (MANDATORY)

Before EVERY commit, run all three checks in order:

1. `npx tsc --noEmit` — must exit 0
2. `npx eslint --config config/lint/eslint.config.js . --quiet` — must have 0 errors
3. `npm run test:unit` — must pass all shards

If any check fails, DO NOT commit. Fix the failures first.

A pre-commit hook enforces checks 1-2 automatically, plus: **fix commits must include a regression test** (the hook rejects `fix:` / `fix(` commits without new test blocks). Run `bash scripts/install-hooks.sh` to install it.

### Integration Test Gate (Service Changes)

When modifying files in `server/src/config/services.config.ts`, `server/src/config/services.initialize.ts`, `server/src/app.ts`, `server/src/server.ts`, or `server/index.ts`, also run:

```bash
PORT=0 npx vitest run tests/integration/bootstrap.integration.test.ts tests/integration/di-container.integration.test.ts --config config/test/vitest.integration.config.js
```

If these fail, the change broke application startup or DI wiring. Fix the source code, not the tests.

### Commit Scope Rules

- Maximum ~10 files per commit unless it's a mechanical refactor (rename, import path change).
- If a fix requires touching 20+ files, stop and reconsider — there's probably a root cause fix that touches 2-3 files.
- Never combine dependency upgrades with code changes in the same commit.
- Never combine test infrastructure changes with production code changes.

### Change Scope Limits

- Type changes to shared interfaces: must run `tsc --noEmit` BEFORE continuing to other files.
- Dependency version bumps: isolated commit, nothing else in it.
- If fixing types requires adding `| null` or `| undefined` to more than 3 interfaces, STOP — find the root cause instead of widening types.
- If a test fix requires changing the production type to make it pass, that's a production code change — treat it accordingly.

## Code Rules

### SRP / File Splitting

Before modifying code, ask: how many distinct responsibilities does this file have? How many reasons to change?

| Type | Split When |
|------|-----------|
| Components | Mixed presentation + business logic |
| Hooks | Managing unrelated state domains |
| Services | Multiple reasons to change |
| Utils | Functions with different concerns |

Do NOT split files solely because they exceed a line threshold.

### TypeScript Rules

- **No `any`**: Use `unknown` + type guards, generics, or `Record<string, unknown>`
- **No magic strings**: Lift to union types or `as const` arrays
- **Zod at boundaries**: Validate API responses, user input, URL params, localStorage
- **Explicit return types**: Required for exported functions and async functions
- **Prefer `undefined`**: Over `null` (except when API explicitly returns null)
- Do NOT use `?.` more than 2 levels deep (fix your types instead)

## UX Behavioral Rules

These are architectural constraints, not styling opinions.

1. **Browsing is read-only. Editing is explicit.** Viewing past state never mutates the current working prompt or settings. Any state restoration requires a deliberate, labeled action. If clicking something can lose the user's work, the design is wrong.

2. **Tools persist. Navigation interrupts.** Panels the user checks repeatedly must remain visible while switching contexts. Opening one panel should not close an unrelated panel.

## Validation Order Before Handoff

1. `npx tsc --noEmit`
2. `npm run lint:all`
3. `npm run test:unit`
4. `npm run test:e2e` (or targeted e2e spec if scope is narrow)
5. `npm run build`

## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

### Services Overview

| Service | Port | Command | Notes |
|---------|------|---------|-------|
| Vite client | 5173 | `npm run dev` | React frontend; works independently of the server |
| Express API | 3001 | `npm run server` | Requires Firebase Admin credentials (see below) |
| Both | 5173+3001 | `npm start` | Concurrently runs both via `scripts/dev/start.ts` |

### Firebase Credentials (Server Startup Blocker)

The Express server runs `admin.auth().listUsers()` and `firestore.listCollections()` on every startup (in `server/src/config/services.initialize.ts`). Without a valid Firebase service account, the server exits with `FATAL: Application failed to start`. This check is **only** skipped when `NODE_ENV=test`.

To start the server, you need **one** of:
- `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` env var containing the full service account JSON
- `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH` env var pointing to an existing JSON file on disk
- `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` env var pointing to an existing JSON file on disk

If these secrets are configured but reference file paths that don't exist on disk, the server will fail.

### Running Without the Server

The Vite client (`npm run dev`) runs independently and renders the full UI. API calls to `/api/*` and `/llm/*` will fail, but all frontend-only development (components, styling, state management) works fine.

### Key Environment Config

- `PROMPT_OUTPUT_ONLY=true` in `.env` disables video generation routes and skips GLiNER model download requirement.
- Redis is optional; comment out `REDIS_URL` to use in-memory cache fallback.
- The `.env` file is created from `.env.example` with placeholder Firebase values.

### Commands Reference

Standard commands are documented in root `CLAUDE.md` under **Commands**. Key ones:
- Lint: `npm run lint` (ESLint), `npm run lint:css` (Stylelint), `npm run lint:all` (both)
- Type check: `npx tsc --noEmit`
- Unit tests: `npm run test:unit` (Vitest, ~5700+ tests)
- Build: `npm run build` (Vite production build)
- Pre-commit checks run automatically via git hooks installed by `npm install` (`prepare` script)

### Pre-existing Test Failures

There are 5 pre-existing unit test failures related to `LlmClientFactory` provider detection and `DepthEstimationService` availability checks. These are not environment-related.
