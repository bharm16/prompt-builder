## 2. Technical Differentiators (Articulated for Non-Technical Buyers)

### 2.1 Semantic Span Labeling
**Technical Reality:**
Uses NLP + LLM hybrid pipeline to identify and categorize every meaningful element in a prompt: subjects, actions, environments, lighting, camera movements, styles, and technical specifications. Supports 9 primary categories with 40+ sub-attributes.

**Business Translation:**
> "Vidra reads your prompt like a director reads a script - identifying every actor, location, lighting cue, and camera movement. This means you can edit with surgical precision instead of rewriting entire prompts."

### 2.2 Click-to-Enhance Suggestions
**Technical Reality:**
Context-aware suggestion generation using multiple LLM providers with contrastive diversity enforcement, category alignment, and video-specific constraint validation. Suggestions are pre-validated against video model capabilities.

**Business Translation:**
> "Highlight any part of your prompt and get intelligent alternatives instantly. Not random variations - contextually appropriate options that maintain your creative vision while improving technical quality."

### 2.3 Two-Stage Optimization Pipeline
**Technical Reality:**
Fast draft generation (1-3 seconds) followed by quality refinement pass. Includes shot interpretation, quality assessment scoring, and optional Constitutional AI review.

**Business Translation:**
> "Get a working draft in seconds, then watch Vidra refine it to production quality in the background. You start iterating immediately while optimization continues."

### 2.4 Cinematography-Aware Taxonomy
**Technical Reality:**
Built-in vocabulary covering shot types, camera angles, camera movements, lighting qualities, and subject positions with compatibility matrices (e.g., which movements work with which shot types).

**Business Translation:**
> "Vidra speaks the language of film. It knows that a dolly-in works differently than a zoom, and that certain movements don't make sense with certain framings. This knowledge is built into every suggestion."

### 2.5 Multi-Model Compilation
**Technical Reality:**
Model-specific prompt compilation that adapts optimized prompts to target video generation models (Runway, Pika, Kling, etc.) based on their unique requirements.

**Business Translation:**
> "Write once, optimize everywhere. Vidra tailors your prompt for whichever AI video platform you're using - no need to learn each platform's quirks."

### 2.6 Image-to-Video (I2V) Intelligence
**Technical Reality:**
Image observation service that analyzes starting frames and constrains suggestions to respect locked visual elements while focusing on motion and temporal changes.

**Business Translation:**
> "When animating a still image, Vidra understands what's already 'locked' visually and focuses suggestions on how things should move - not what they should look like."

## 5. Sales Conversation Talking Points

### Discovery Questions

1. **Current Workflow:** "How many iterations does it typically take to get the video output you want?"
2. **Pain Points:** "Where do you spend the most time in your AI video workflow - prompting, generating, or post-editing?"
3. **Quality Standards:** "How do you currently ensure consistent quality across your video content?"
4. **Team Dynamics:** "Do all team members have the same level of prompt engineering skill?"
5. **Platform Usage:** "Which AI video platforms are you currently using? Do you switch between them?"

### Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We already have prompt templates" | "Templates are static. Vidra provides dynamic, context-aware suggestions that adapt to each unique prompt. Plus, our semantic analysis identifies gaps your templates might miss." |
| "Our team has prompt engineering expertise" | "Great - Vidra accelerates experts with one-click enhancements and quality scoring. Your experts will move even faster while training up the rest of the team." |
| "We use [Runway/Pika] which has its own interface" | "Vidra optimizes prompts before they reach any platform. Think of it as a prompt compiler - you write once and Vidra adapts for whichever platform you choose." |
| "General prompt tools are cheaper" | "General tools don't understand video. They optimize for text generation, not visual storytelling. The time you save avoiding wrong outputs pays for Vidra in the first project." |
| "We're waiting to see how AI video matures" | "The models will keep improving, but prompt engineering will remain critical. Investing in prompt mastery now means you're ready to leverage every model improvement instantly." |

### Competitive Positioning Statements

**Against Runway/Pika native interfaces:**
