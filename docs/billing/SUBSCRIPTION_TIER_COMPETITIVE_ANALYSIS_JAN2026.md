# Subscription Tier & Credit Analysis Report

> **Report Date:** January 2026
> **Purpose:** Competitive analysis of subscription pricing and credit allocation

## Executive Summary

Your subscription pricing is **competitive but potentially underpriced** at the mid-tier compared to market leaders. Based on January 2026 market research, your credits-per-dollar ratio is generous, which is good for customer acquisition but may compress margins on the Creator tier specifically.

**Key Finding:** Your per-credit cost ranges from $0.036-$0.048, which is more generous than most competitors (Runway $0.012-0.019/credit, but their credits cost more per video). The issue isn't your tiers—it's ensuring your per-second model costs are properly calibrated to your credit economics.

## Competitive Positioning Matrix

| Service | Entry Tier | Mid Tier | Pro Tier | Your Position |
|---------|------------|----------|----------|---------------|
| **Your Service** | $19 (400 cr) | $59 (1,500 cr) | $179 (5,000 cr) | - |
| Runway | $12 (625 cr) | $28 (2,250 cr) | $76 (unlimited) | **You're 58% more expensive at entry** |
| Pika | $8 (700 cr) | $28 (2,300 cr) | $76 (6,000 cr) | **You're 138% more expensive at entry** |
| Kling | $10 (660 cr) | $37 (3,000 cr) | $92 (8,000 cr) | **You're 90% more expensive at entry** |
| Luma | $10 (1,600 cr) | $30 (4,800 cr) | $100 (15,300 cr) | **You're 90% more expensive at entry** |
| Hailuo | $15 (1,000 cr) | $55 (4,500 cr) | $120 (10,000 cr) | **You're 27% more expensive at entry** |

---

## Key Insights

### 1. Your Entry Tier is Expensive
At $19/month for 400 credits, you're pricing above every major competitor:
- Pika: $8 for 700 credits (75% more credits for 58% less money)
- Kling: $10 for 660 credits (65% more credits for 47% less money)
- Runway: $12 for 625 credits (56% more credits for 37% less money)

### 2. Your Mid-Tier is Competitive
At $59/month for 1,500 credits, you're in the same ballpark as:
- Hailuo Pro: $55 for 4,500 credits (but their credits are worth less per video)
- Kling Pro: $37 for 3,000 credits

### 3. Your Credit Value is Higher
Your credits are worth more because they convert to more video output per credit when using budget models (WAN). The key is that your per-credit cost structure with per-second pricing means:
- 1 credit ≈ $0.04-0.05 revenue
- 1 credit = 0.5 seconds of WAN video OR 0.016 seconds of Veo 3

### 4. Multi-Model Access is Your Differentiator
Unlike Runway (Gen-4 only), Pika (Pika models only), or Luma (Ray models only), you offer access to **multiple providers** (Sora, Veo, Luma, Kling, WAN, Hailuo). This justifies a premium.

---

## Recommendations

### Option A: Keep Current Pricing (Justified Premium)

**Rationale:** Your multi-model access justifies the premium. Users get:
- OpenAI Sora 2 (not available on Runway/Pika)
- Google Veo 3 (unique feature)
- Luma Ray3, Kling, WAN
- Unified credit system across all providers

**Risk:** May lose price-sensitive users to Pika ($8) or Kling ($10).

### Option B: Lower Entry Tier (Market Competitive)

| Tier | Current | Proposed | Change |
|------|---------|----------|--------|
| Explorer | $19 / 400 cr | $12 / 300 cr | -37% price, -25% credits |
| Creator | $59 / 1,500 cr | $49 / 1,200 cr | -17% price, -20% credits |
| Agency | $179 / 5,000 cr | $149 / 4,000 cr | -17% price, -20% credits |

**Rationale:** Matches Runway's entry point while maintaining margin through reduced credits.

### Option C: Add a Starter Tier (Expand Funnel)

| Tier | Price | Credits | Target |
|------|-------|---------|--------|
| **Starter (NEW)** | $9 | 200 | Hobbyists, price-sensitive |
| Explorer | $19 | 400 | Casual creators |
| Creator | $59 | 1,500 | Active creators |
| Agency | $179 | 5,000 | Teams |

**Rationale:** Captures users who would otherwise go to Pika ($8) or Kaiber ($5).

## Video Output Comparison (With New Per-Second Pricing)

How many videos can users create per tier with your updated pricing?

### Using WAN Draft (2 credits/sec × 8s = 16 credits)

| Tier | Credits | WAN 8s Videos |
|------|---------|---------------|
| Explorer | 400 | 25 videos/month |
| Creator | 1,500 | 93 videos/month |
| Agency | 5,000 | 312 videos/month |

### Using Kling (8 credits/sec × 8s = 64 credits)

| Tier | Credits | Kling 8s Videos |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| Explorer | 400 | 6 videos/month |
| Creator | 1,500 | 23 videos/month |
| Agency | 5,000 | 78 videos/month |

### Using Sora 2 Pro (35 credits/sec × 8s = 280 credits)

| Tier | Credits | Sora 2 Pro 8s Videos |
|------|---------|----------------------|
| Explorer | 400 | 1 video/month |
| Creator | 1,500 | 5 videos/month |
| Agency | 5,000 | 17 videos/month |

### Using Veo 3 (60 credits/sec × 8s = 480 credits)

| Tier | Credits | Veo 3 8s Videos |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| Explorer | 400 | 0 videos/month ⚠️ |
| Creator | 1,500 | 3 videos/month |
| Agency | 5,000 | 10 videos/month |

**Critical Issue:** Explorer tier users **cannot afford a single Veo 3 video** with your new pricing (480 credits required, 400 credits available). Consider either:
1. Increasing Explorer credits to 500
2. Communicating that premium models require Creator tier or above

---

## Final Verdict

### Your tiers are **reasonable but not optimized** for the current market:

| Aspect | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Entry Price | ⚠️ High | $19 vs market avg $10 |
| Mid-Tier Value | ✅ Good | Competitive with Hailuo/Kling Pro |
| Top-Tier Value | ✅ Good | Good for agency volume |
| Credit Packs | ✅ Excellent | Better value than competitors |
| Multi-Model Access | ✅ Excellent | Unique differentiator |

### Recommended Actions

1. **Consider a $9-12 Starter tier** to compete with Pika/Kling entry pricing
2. **Increase Explorer credits to 500** so users can access at least one premium model video
3. **Emphasize multi-model access** in marketing to justify premium pricing
4. **Monitor conversion rates** at Explorer tier - if low, price may be the barrier
