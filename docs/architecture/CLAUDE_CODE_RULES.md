# Rules for Claude Code

## The Only Question That Matters

> **"How many reasons does this have to change?"**

If the answer is 1, don't touch it. If the answer is 2+, split by responsibility.

## Before Writing Code

### 1. Responsibility Check
Ask: *"Can I describe what this does in one sentence without using 'and'?"*

- ✅ "Manages wizard step navigation"
- ❌ "Manages wizard steps and validates form input and calls the API"

If you need "and," you have multiple responsibilities. Split them.

### 2. Testability Check
Ask: *"Can I test this by mocking ≤2 dependencies?"*

If you need to mock 5 things to test one function, that function knows too much. Extract what it's reaching into.

### 3. Change Coupling Check
Ask: *"When I change X, what else breaks?"*

If changing the API response format requires touching 6 files, you have a coupling problem. The parser should live in one place.

## Where Things Go

| Thing | Location | Why |
|-------|----------|-----|
| HTTP calls | `api/` layer | One place to change when endpoints change |
| State logic | `hooks/` (useReducer) | Testable without rendering |
| Business rules | `services/` (backend) or `hooks/` (frontend) | Isolate from UI concerns |
| Pure transforms | `utils/` | No dependencies, easy to test |
| Display decisions | Components | Keep rendering concerns together |
| Configuration | `config/` | Change without touching logic |

**The test:** If you're importing something from a different layer to make a change, the responsibility is in the wrong place.

## Patterns

### Frontend: VideoConceptBuilder Pattern
```
ComponentName/
├── ComponentName.jsx    → Orchestration: wires pieces together, no logic
├── hooks/               → State: all useReducer, derived state, handlers
├── api/                 → Network: fetch wrappers, response parsing
├── components/          → Display: receives props, renders UI
├── utils/               → Transforms: pure functions, no side effects
└── config/              → Data: constants, defaults, options
```

**Orchestrator test:** If `ComponentName.jsx` has an `if` statement with business logic, extract it.

### Backend: PromptOptimizationService Pattern
```
ServiceName/
├── ServiceName.js       → Orchestration: coordinates specialized services
├── services/            → Logic: each service = one responsibility
├── repositories/        → Data: database/API access
└── templates/           → Prompts: external .md files
```

**Orchestrator test:** If the main service file has more than coordination logic, extract a specialized service.

## When to Split

Split when you can answer YES to any of these:

1. **Different stakeholders care about different parts**
   - Designer changes styles, backend dev changes data fetching → separate
   
2. **Different triggers cause changes**
   - API contract change vs. UI redesign → separate
   
3. **You want to test parts independently**
   - Validation logic vs. form rendering → separate

4. **Parts could be reused elsewhere**
   - Date formatting used in 3 components → extract to utils

## When NOT to Split

Don't split when:

1. **The pieces always change together**
   - Splitting creates "shotgun surgery" (one change, many files)

2. **The pieces only make sense together**
   - A modal and its content that's never reused

3. **You're hitting some arbitrary line count**
   - A 600-line state machine with one responsibility is fine

4. **You're adding indirection without benefit**
   - A wrapper function that just calls another function

---

## Code Smells to Watch For

| Smell | Symptom | Fix |
|-------|---------|-----|
| **Feature Envy** | Function uses more data from another module than its own | Move it to that module |
| **Shotgun Surgery** | One conceptual change requires editing 5+ files | Consolidate the responsibility |
| **God Object** | One file that everything depends on | Split by responsibility |
| **Primitive Obsession** | Passing 5 related strings instead of an object | Create a type/object |
| **Inappropriate Intimacy** | Module reaches into another's internals | Define a proper interface |

---

## Validation Questions

After any change, ask:

1. **Can I explain what each file does in ≤10 words?**
2. **Do the files that change together live together?**
3. **Can I test each piece with minimal mocking?**
4. **If I delete this file, does exactly one capability disappear?**

If any answer is "no," you have a cohesion problem—not a line count problem.
