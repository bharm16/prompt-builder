# Async Job Unification — Migration Plan

**Status:** Proposed
**Owner:** backend platform
**Depends on:** Removal of `VIDEO_JOB_INLINE_ENABLED` (shipped prior to this plan)

## Why this plan exists

The Vidra backend has one good answer for long-running provider calls — the firestore-backed job system in `server/src/services/video-generation/jobs/` — and applies it to exactly one feature (video generation). At least two other features that do the same kind of work — image preview generation (Flux Schnell, 15-30s) and continuity shot generation (30-120s+) — block the HTTP request thread synchronously instead.

The result is three different shapes for the same problem:

| Feature                    | Transport               | Latency  | Durable? | Retry?      | Client poll?       |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------- | -------- | ----------- | ------------------ |
| Video generation           | 202 + job record + poll | 30s–5min | Yes      | Yes         | Yes                |
| Image generation (Flux)    | sync HTTP               | 15–30s   | No       | Inline only | No (request hangs) |
| Continuity shot generation | sync HTTP               | 30–120s+ | No       | No          | No                 |

This plan takes the existing video job system, generalizes it into a reusable `JobEngine` with pluggable handlers, and migrates the other two features onto it. Refund state — today stranded in a separate `RefundFailureStore` with its own sweeper worker — becomes a property of the job record, collapsing one background worker into the job state machine.

## Non-goals

- **Not changing the client-server transport shape of non-async endpoints.** Prompt optimization (SSE), span labeling, enhancement, model intelligence — all stay as they are. They complete fast enough to not need durability.
- **Not introducing event-driven queue infrastructure.** No pub/sub, no firestore triggers. Continue with the existing claim-and-poll model; revisit only if firestore read cost becomes a measurable problem.
- **Not touching external reconcilers.** The Stripe webhook replay worker, the Stripe invoice reconciler, and the GCS asset reconciler consume external event streams and are correctly independent of the internal job pipeline.

Workers after the migration: **4** (JobEngine, StripeWebhookReconciler, StripeInvoiceReconciler, GcsAssetReconciler) — down from 7.

## Migration steps

The plan is strictly incremental. Every step is independently shippable, independently reversible, and independently observable in production.

### Step 2 — Extract `JobEngine` from `VideoJobWorker`

**Status:** Next up
**Scope:** ~20-40 files. Behavior-preserving refactor. No new features.

**Plan:**

1. Introduce `server/src/services/jobs/` (new directory):
   - `JobEngine.ts` — class, renamed copy of `VideoJobWorker.ts` with video specifics extracted
   - `JobHandler.ts` — interface: `{ type: string; claim(record): Promise<ClaimedJob|null>; process(job, ctx): Promise<JobResult>; }`
   - `types.ts` — generic `JobRecord<TInput, TResult>`, discriminated by `type`
2. Move video-specific code:
   - `server/src/services/video-generation/jobs/VideoJobHandler.ts` — implements `JobHandler`. Wraps current `processVideoJob.ts` logic unchanged.
3. Wiring: `server/src/config/services/generation.services.ts` registers `JobEngine` with `[videoHandler]` as the only handler. The old `VideoJobWorker` DI token becomes an alias for the engine for one release, then is removed.
4. Inline processor in `server/src/routes/preview/inlineProcessor.ts` still uses `videoJobStore.claimJob` directly — it doesn't need the engine. No change here.
5. Tests: all existing `VideoJobWorker` tests move to `JobEngine` tests, semantically identical.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Running video generation end-to-end produces identical metrics, logs, and job-record transitions
- `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npx eslint`, `npm run test:unit`, bootstrap+DI integration gate, `npm run build` all green
- Prod deploy surfaces zero new error categories in the 24h following rollout

**Rollback:** revert the PR. DI alias means in-flight jobs are unaffected.

### Step 3 — Refund-as-job-field; collapse `CreditRefundSweeper`

**Status:** Requires prod observation window
**Scope:** ~15-25 files. Schema change + dual-run.

**Plan:**

1. Add `refundStatus: "n/a" | "pending" | "committed" | "failed"` to `VideoJobRecord` (default `"n/a"` for new jobs; `"n/a"` for legacy jobs at read time via schema normalization).
2. On any status transition to `"failed"`, inside the same firestore transaction set `refundStatus = "pending"`. Keep writing to `RefundFailureStore` as before (mirror writes).
3. Extend `JobEngine` with a post-process step: if `status === "failed" && refundStatus === "pending"`, call `refundWithGuard`, then set `refundStatus = "committed"`.
4. **Observe for 1-2 weeks**: instrument a metric comparing `RefundFailureStore` entries vs. jobs in `refundStatus = pending`. They must stay in sync. If they diverge, abort and investigate.
5. Flip reads: any code that queried `RefundFailureStore` now queries jobs with `refundStatus = pending`. Keep writes to both stores.
6. **Observe for another week.** Then delete `RefundFailureStore` + `CreditRefundSweeper` + associated DI wiring.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Zero discrepancies between mirror and primary during observation windows
- Credit reconciliation reports show no unexpected deltas
- The number of background workers decreases by exactly 1 after cleanup

**Rollback:** while mirror-writes are running, either read source is authoritative. Post-cutover, rollback requires restoring the store, which is a data-migration rollback and must be explicitly approved.

### Step 4 — Migrate continuity shot generation onto `JobEngine`

**Status:** After Step 2 lands
**Scope:** ~25-40 files. User-facing behavior change (async instead of sync).

**Plan:**

1. New handler: `server/src/services/continuity/shot-generation/ContinuityShotHandler.ts` implementing `JobHandler`. Wraps current sync generation logic.
2. Route change: `POST /api/v2/sessions/:id/shots/:shotId/generate` returns `202 { jobId }` instead of blocking. The existing shot status endpoint (`GET /api/v2/sessions/:id/shots/:shotId/status`) is extended to surface job state.
3. Client change in `client/src/features/continuity/`: replace the blocking `await generate()` with job-id + polling (same shape as `pollJobStatus.ts`).
4. Credit reservation moves from inline to `createJobWithReservation` at the handler entry.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Continuity shot flows produce visibly identical outputs to users
- Credit balances stay correct across generation + refund scenarios (property test: generate N shots, cancel half, assert final balance)
- No regression in continuity-session integration tests

**Rollback:** keep the old sync endpoint behind a `CONTINUITY_SHOT_JOB_ENABLED` boolean flag (temporary — deleted when step 6 ships). If jobs misbehave, flip the flag, sync path returns.

### Step 5 — Migrate image generation (Flux Schnell) onto `JobEngine`

**Status:** After Step 2 lands; can be parallel with Step 4
**Scope:** ~20-30 files. User-facing latency change (mitigable).

**Plan:**

1. New handler: `server/src/services/image-generation/ImageGenerationHandler.ts` implementing `JobHandler`.
2. Route change: `POST /api/preview/image/generate` becomes async.
3. **Latency mitigation:** the route handler synchronously waits up to 2000ms for the handler to complete. If it finishes in time, return 200 with the image URL (sync-appearing). Otherwise return 202 + jobId, and the client resolves via listener/poll. Fast-path preserves the current perceived-latency in the happy case.
4. Client change in `client/src/features/preview/`: accept either shape from the endpoint.
5. Credit reservation moves to handler entry.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- P50 latency to first pixel is unchanged within ±200ms
- P99 latency to first pixel improves (long-tail no longer holds the request socket)
- Credit lifecycle remains exactly-once

**Rollback:** `IMAGE_GEN_JOB_ENABLED` flag, same pattern as Step 4.

### Step 6 — Client-side: firestore listener replaces polling

**Status:** After Steps 4 & 5
**Scope:** ~15-25 client files. Transport swap, feature-flag gated.

**Plan:**

1. Add `client/src/features/jobs/useJobListener.ts` — firebase SDK subscribe to `jobs/:id`. Returns the same hook shape as the existing `usePolledJob` (drop-in).
2. Gate behind `VIDRA_JOB_LISTENER_ENABLED` (client-side flag). Ship off; enable for a canary population; then full.
3. Once stable, delete `client/src/features/preview/api/pollJobStatus.ts` and migrate all callers.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Zero-polling mode: instrumentation confirms `GET /api/jobs/:id` request rate drops to ~0 for users with the flag on
- Time-to-visible-result improves by the previous polling interval on average (~1-4s)
- No increase in "job stuck" user reports

**Rollback:** flip the flag. Client falls back to polling.

## Cross-cutting concerns

### Observability

Each step must land instrumentation before the code path is exercised:

- Step 2: `job_engine.handler.invocations{type}`, `job_engine.handler.errors{type}`
- Step 3: `job.refund_status_transitions{from,to}`, `refund_store.divergence_count`
- Step 4/5: `jobs.created{type}`, `jobs.completed{type}`, `jobs.duration{type}` histograms
- Step 6: `client.listener.attach`, `client.listener.update_latency_ms`

### Schema evolution

`VideoJobRecord` (→ generalized `JobRecord`) must remain backwards-readable across the migration:

- Step 2: no field changes; just new `type` field defaulted to `"video"` for legacy records
- Step 3: `refundStatus` defaults to `"n/a"` for legacy records at read time
- Steps 4/5: new job type values — readers must tolerate unknown types (log + skip, not throw)

### Rollback posture

Every step ships with a bypass: either a feature flag (Steps 4, 5, 6) or a mirror write (Step 3) or a DI alias (Step 2). No step requires a "flag day" deploy.

## Open questions to resolve before starting each step

- **Step 2:** do we generalize `VideoJobStore` into `JobStore<T>`, or keep it video-specific and have each handler bring its own store? (Recommendation: generalize; sole store keeps observability simple.)
- **Step 3:** what's the upper bound on how long `refundStatus = "pending"` jobs can sit? (Propose: 24h, then pager. Credits are money.)
- **Step 4:** does the client UI need a progress indicator for shot generation, or is a spinner sufficient? (Ask UX.)
- **Step 5:** what's the right value for the sync-wait ceiling? 2s is a guess — we should measure P50 Flux latency and set it above that. (Instrument first.)
- **Step 6:** firebase SDK size impact on the client bundle? Measure before rollout.
