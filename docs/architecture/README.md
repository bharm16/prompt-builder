## Quick Start

**Refactoring a large component?**
→ Read `REFACTORING_PATTERN.md` and follow the checklist

**Asking Claude Code to build a feature?**
→ Use `.claude-code-template.md` format

**Reviewing a PR?**
→ Check against `REFACTORING_STANDARD.md` requirements

**Onboarding a new developer?**
→ Start with `REFACTORING_STANDARD.md`

## Examples

Successful refactorings following these patterns:
