## üß™ Manual Testing

### Test Case 1: Technical/Expert Prompt

**Test this:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/optimize \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "analyze the current implementation behind the prompt canvas editor highlighting feature, and help me come up with a solution to reduce the amount of time it takes to parse the text and apply the highlights. its currently too slow to be a viable feature",
    "mode": "reasoning"
  }'
```

**Expected behavior:**
- Should make 2 API calls (inference + optimization)
- Should infer expert-level context
- Output should be highly technical with:
  - DOM manipulation specifics
  - Parsing algorithm details
  - Performance metrics
  - Code-level recommendations

**Check logs for:**
```
Auto-inferring context for reasoning mode
Successfully inferred context: {
  hasSpecificAspects: true,
  backgroundLevel: 'expert',
  hasIntendedUse: true
}
```

---

### Test Case 2: Business/Intermediate Prompt

**Test this:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/optimize \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "should we expand our SaaS product into Europe or focus on deepening penetration in North America",
    "mode": "reasoning"
  }'
```

**Expected behavior:**
- Should infer business strategy context
- Output should include:
  - Market analysis frameworks
  - ROI considerations
  - Strategic trade-offs
  - Risk assessment

**Inferred context should be:**
```json
{
  "specificAspects": "market expansion, competitive analysis, regulatory compliance, resource allocation",
  "backgroundLevel": "intermediate",
  "intendedUse": "strategic planning"
}
```

---

### Test Case 3: Learning/Novice Prompt

**Test this:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/optimize \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "explain how neural networks learn",
    "mode": "reasoning"
  }'
```

**Expected behavior:**
- Should infer novice-level context
- Output should be educational:
  - Clear explanations
  - Analogies and examples
  - Foundational concepts
  - Less jargon

**Inferred context should be:**
```json
{
  "specificAspects": "backpropagation, gradient descent, loss functions, training process",
  "backgroundLevel": "novice",
  "intendedUse": "learning fundamentals"
}
```

---

### Test Case 4: Manual Context Override

**Test this:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/optimize \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "optimize my code",
    "mode": "reasoning",
    "context": {
      "specificAspects": "React hooks, memoization strategies",
      "backgroundLevel": "expert",
      "intendedUse": "production optimization"
    }
  }'
```

**Expected behavior:**
- Should use provided context (no inference)
- Should only make 1 API call (optimization only)
- Output should respect manual context

**Check logs for:**
```
# Should NOT see:
Auto-inferring context for reasoning mode

# Should see manual context being used
```

---

### Test Case 5: Non-Reasoning Mode

**Test this:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/optimize \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "write a Python function to sort a list",
    "mode": "code"
  }'
```

**Expected behavior:**
- Should NOT infer context (only for reasoning mode)
- Should make 1 API call (optimization only)
- Works normally without inference

---

## üìù Quick Verification Checklist

Run these checks to verify everything is working:

- [ ] **Unit tests pass:** `npm test -- PromptOptimizationService.reasoning-context.test.js`
- [ ] **Server starts:** `npm start`
- [ ] **Technical prompt gets technical output** (Test Case 1)
- [ ] **Business prompt gets business output** (Test Case 2)
- [ ] **Learning prompt gets educational output** (Test Case 3)
- [ ] **Manual context overrides auto-inference** (Test Case 4)
- [ ] **Other modes work normally** (Test Case 5)
- [ ] **Logs show inference activity** (check console output)

---

## üîç Monitoring in Production

After deployment, monitor these metrics:

### API Call Patterns
- Reasoning mode: 2 calls (inference + optimization)
- Other modes: 1 call (optimization only)
- Manual context: 1 call (optimization only)

### Logs to Watch
```
‚úÖ Good:
- "Auto-inferring context for reasoning mode"
- "Successfully inferred context"

‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:
- "Invalid background level, defaulting to intermediate"

‚ùå Error (but handled):
- "Failed to infer context from prompt"
  (System continues with fallback context)
```

### Performance Impact
- **Latency:** +300-500ms for reasoning mode
- **Cost:** ~$0.001 per reasoning optimization
- **Accuracy:** Claude's reasoning ensures high-quality inference

---

## üéØ Expected Output Quality

### Before (without context)
```
**Goal**
Improve the efficiency of the text highlighting feature.

**Return Format**
- Analysis of current implementation
- Suggestions for optimization
```

### After (with auto-inferred context)
```
**Goal**
Analyze the performance bottlenecks in the prompt canvas editor's text
highlighting implementation and develop an optimized solution that
significantly reduces parsing and highlight application time to make
the feature production-viable.

**Return Format**
1. **Current Implementation Analysis**: Identify likely performance
   bottlenecks (DOM manipulation frequency, parsing algorithms,
   re-render triggers)
2. **Performance Metrics**: Estimate impact of each bottleneck
3. **Optimization Strategy**: Prioritized list of solutions by
   impact-to-effort ratio
4. **Recommended Implementation**: Code-level changes, data structures,
   caching strategies
5. **Expected Performance Gains**: Quantified improvement in
   parsing/highlighting speed

**Warnings**
- Avoid solutions that compromise text accuracy or introduce visual artifacts
- Consider edge cases: 10,000+ char prompts, rapid typing, overlapping
  highlights, Unicode
- Don't assume specific framework without reasoning about framework-agnostic
  optimizations first
- Account for dynamic highlight updates as text changes
- Evaluate whether bottleneck is parsing logic, DOM manipulation, or both
- Consider that premature optimization of non-critical paths adds complexity
```

---

## üîÑ Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If issues occur, disable auto-inference:

```javascript
// In optimize() method, comment out these lines:
/*
if (mode === 'reasoning' && !context) {
  logger.info('Auto-inferring context for reasoning mode');
  context = await this.inferContextFromPrompt(prompt);
  logger.debug('Inferred context', { context });
}
*/
```

Or use environment variable:
```bash
export AUTO_INFER_CONTEXT=false
```
