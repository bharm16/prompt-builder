## Domain Glossary

These terms have specific meanings in this codebase. Do not conflate them.

| Term | Meaning | Server Path | Route |
|------|---------|-------------|-------|
| **Span labeling** | ML categorization of prompt phrases into taxonomy categories (subject, camera, lighting…) for UI highlights | `server/src/llm/span-labeling/` | `/llm/label-spans` |
| **Enhancement / Suggestions** | AI-generated alternative phrases for a user-selected span (click-to-enhance) | `server/src/services/enhancement/` | `/api/suggestions`, `/api/enhance` |
| **Optimization** | Two-stage prompt rewriting pipeline (Groq fast draft → OpenAI refinement) | `server/src/services/prompt-optimization/` | `/api/optimize-stream` (SSE) |
| **Continuity** | Shot-to-shot visual consistency in multi-shot sequences (frame-bridge, style-match) | `server/src/services/continuity/` | `/api/continuity` |
| **Convergence** | Motion and visual convergence pipeline (iterative refinement toward target) | `server/src/services/convergence/` | `/api/motion` |
| **Video Concept** | Guided wizard flow: subject → action → location → camera → lighting → style | `server/src/services/video-concept/` | via `/api` routes |
| **Model Intelligence** | AI-powered model recommendation based on prompt analysis | `server/src/services/model-intelligence/` | `/api/model-intelligence` |
| **Preview** | Image (Flux Schnell) and video (Wan 2.2) draft generation before final render | `server/src/services/image-generation/`, `server/src/services/video-generation/` | `/api/preview` |
| **Generation** | Final video render via Sora, Veo, Kling, Luma, Runway | `server/src/services/video-generation/` | `/api/preview` (shared routes) |

**Critical distinction:** `EnhancementService.ts` and `VideoConceptService.ts` at the root of `server/src/services/` are **legacy files**. Import from the domain subdirectories (`enhancement/`, `video-concept/`).

See also: `docs/architecture/SERVICE_BOUNDARIES.md`.

## Service Architecture

Services are registered via domain-scoped files in `server/src/config/services/`:

| Registration File | Registers |
|---|---|
| `infrastructure.services.ts` | cache, metrics, Firebase clients, storage, assets, credits |
| `llm.services.ts` | aiService, claudeClient, groqClient, geminiClient |
| `enhancement.services.ts` | enhancementService, sceneDetection, coherence, videoPromptAnalysis |
| `generation.services.ts` | imageGeneration, videoGeneration, storyboardPreview, keyframe, faceSwap |
| `continuity.services.ts` | continuitySessionService (gated — see Feature Flags) |
| `session.services.ts` | sessionService, modelIntelligence |

Container created in `server/src/config/services.config.ts`, initialized in `services.initialize.ts`. Routes consume services via factories in `server/src/config/routes.config.ts`.

Dependency rules:
- **Constructor injection** only — never `container.resolve()` outside route factories or DI config.
- `aiService` is the **only** LLM routing layer. Never call provider clients directly from business services.
- Cross-domain dependencies flow through route layer or orchestrator, not direct imports.

## Feature Flags

| Flag | Default | Effect |
|------|---------|--------|
| `PROMPT_OUTPUT_ONLY=true` | `false` | Disables ALL preview, video generation, motion, and convergence routes. |
| `ENABLE_CONVERGENCE=false` | `true` | `continuitySessionService` resolves to **`null`**. Must null-check. |

When adding new routes, check `routes.config.ts` for the `promptOutputOnly` guard. Generation routes must be inside that block.

## Route → Service → Client API Map

| Route | Server Route File | Client API/Service |
|-------|-------------------|--------------------|
| `POST /api/optimize-stream` | `optimize.routes.ts` | `services/PromptOptimizationApi.ts` |
| `POST /api/enhance`, `/api/suggestions` | `enhancement.routes.ts`, `suggestions.ts` | `services/EnhancementApi.ts` |
| `POST /llm/label-spans` | `labelSpansRoute.ts` | `features/span-highlighting/api/spanLabelingApi.ts` |
| `/api/preview/*` | `preview.routes.ts` | `features/preview/api/` |
| `/api/payment/*` | `payment.routes.ts` | `api/billingApi.ts` |
| `/api/motion/*` | `motion.routes.ts` | `api/motionApi.ts` |
| `/api/storage/*` | `storage.routes.ts` | `api/storageApi.ts` |
| `/api/capabilities` | `capabilities.routes.ts` | `services/CapabilitiesApi.ts` |
| `/api/continuity/*` | `continuity.routes.ts` | `features/continuity/api/` |
| `/api/model-intelligence/*` | `model-intelligence.routes.ts` | `features/model-intelligence/api/` |
| `/api/sessions/*` | `sessions.routes.ts` | (uses ApiClient directly) |
| `/api/video/*` | `video.routes.ts` | `services/VideoConceptApi.ts` |
| `/api/assets/*` | `asset.routes.ts` | `features/assets/` |
| `/api/reference-images/*` | `reference-images.routes.ts` | `features/reference-images/` |
| `/health` | `health.routes.ts` | (not called from client) |

API calls never go directly in React components. Use `client/src/api/` for thin fetch wrappers, `client/src/services/` for stateful clients, or `client/src/features/<name>/api/` for feature-scoped APIs.

## Architecture rules
- Frontend: follow VideoConceptBuilder pattern in client/src/components/VideoConceptBuilder/.
  - Orchestrator component + hooks/useReducer + api/ + components/.
- Backend: follow PromptOptimizationService pattern in server/src/services/prompt-optimization/PromptOptimizationService.js.
  - Thin orchestrator + specialized services + templates/ (.md).
- API calls live in client/src/api (not inline in components).
- Backend business logic lives in server/src/services.
- SRP/SoC: do not split files solely by line count; thresholds are warnings only.
- File size heuristics: orchestrators ~500 lines, UI components ~200, hooks ~150,
  specialized services ~300, utils ~100.
- Prefer TypeScript, avoid any, and use Zod at boundaries (see docs/architecture/typescript/).

## Environment
- Copy .env.example to .env.
- Required for local dev: VITE_FIREBASE_* and at least one LLM key (ex: OPENAI_API_KEY).

## Common commands
- npm start          Dev orchestrator (see scripts/dev/start.ts)
- npm run dev        Vite client only
- npm run server     API server only
- npm run lint       ESLint
- npm run lint:css   Stylelint
- npm run test       Vitest
- npm run test:e2e   Playwright
- npm run build      Vite build

## Integration tests

Read `docs/architecture/typescript/TEST_GUIDE.md` Part 3 before writing any integration test.

Cardinal rule: **write tests from contracts, not implementations.**

Contract files to read:
- `server/src/config/services.config.ts` (service registrations)
- `server/src/config/services.initialize.ts` (init order, health checks)
- `server/src/app.ts` (middleware, route mounting)
- `server/src/routes/*.routes.ts` (route paths, schemas)
- `server/src/schemas/*.ts` (Zod contracts)

Do NOT read service class internals, handler bodies, or prompt templates when writing assertions.

Workflow:
1. Read contract files.
2. Write assertions against what contracts promise.
3. Run tests — expect failures.
4. Report failures with root cause analysis.
5. STOP. Ask the user whether to fix source code or adjust the test spec.

When fixing failures: default to fixing source code, not the test. Never weaken assertions.

When modifying `services.config.ts`, `services.initialize.ts`, `app.ts`, `server.ts`, or `server/index.ts`, run:
```bash
PORT=0 npx vitest run tests/integration/bootstrap.integration.test.ts tests/integration/di-container.integration.test.ts --config config/test/vitest.integration.config.js
```

## Bugfix protocol

When fixing a bug, follow this sequence exactly:

1. Write a failing test first that reproduces the bug. Unit test for service bugs, integration test for cross-service bugs. Must fail before the fix and pass after.
2. Fix root cause in service/hook layer, not symptom in UI/API layer.
3. Run the new test — must pass.
4. Run full existing suite (`npm run test:unit`) — all existing tests must pass without modification.

Test update rules during bugfixes:
- Never weaken an existing test to accommodate a fix. A failing existing test means your fix changed a contract — treat that as a separate decision.
- Never update a test and the source file it covers in the same logical change unless the contract itself is intentionally changing.
- A failing existing test after a bugfix is information. Investigate before touching the test.
- Default action: add a new test case, don't edit existing ones.

## Working notes
- Keep changes small and consistent with existing patterns.
- Update or add tests for behavior changes.
- See client/GEMINI.md and server/GEMINI.md for subsystem-specific guidance.
- Integration test guide: docs/architecture/typescript/TEST_GUIDE.md (Part 3).
