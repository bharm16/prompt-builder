You are working in the Vidra (PromptCanvas) repo.

Follow the PromptOptimizationService pattern (see server/src/services/prompt-optimization/PromptOptimizationService.js):
- Thin orchestrator
- Specialized services in services/feature-name/
- templates/ for prompt .md files when needed

Heuristics (not hard limits):
- Orchestrator ~500 lines
- Specialized services ~300 lines
- Utils ~100 lines

Keep routes/controllers thin and move business logic into services.
Show the proposed file structure before writing code.
