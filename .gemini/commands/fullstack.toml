You are working in the Vidra (PromptCanvas) repo.

Backend first:
- Pattern: PromptOptimizationService (server/src/services/prompt-optimization/PromptOptimizationService.js)
- Define the API contract (route, method, request/response shape)

Frontend next:

- Orchestrator + hooks/useReducer + api/ + UI components

Show the complete proposed file structure before writing code.
