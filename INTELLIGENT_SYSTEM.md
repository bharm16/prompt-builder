# Intelligent Pattern Recognition System

## Overview

Your prompt builder now uses a **fully adaptive, ML-based pattern recognition system** instead of hardcoded regex patterns. The system learns from your text and behavior to intelligently highlight important phrases.

---

## What Changed

### Before: Hardcoded Pattern System
- 200+ hardcoded regex patterns
- Static categorization rules
- No adaptation to user preferences
- Required manual pattern updates

### After: Intelligent Adaptive System
- **Zero hardcoded patterns**
- Automatic phrase extraction using TF-IDF
- Semantic categorization using NLP
- Learns from every click you make
- Adapts confidence scores over time

---

## How It Works

### 1. **Intelligent Phrase Extraction** (`IntelligentPhraseExtractor.js`)
- Uses **TF-IDF** (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to identify statistically important phrases
- Extracts **n-grams** (1-4 word phrases) automatically
- Calculates **collocation scores** using Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI)
- Filters stopwords and prioritizes technical/domain-specific terms
- **Learns from your documents** - the more you use it, the better it gets

**Key Features:**
- Automatically identifies multi-word phrases (no manual patterns needed)
- Distinguishes technical terms from common words
- Tracks phrase frequency across documents
- Self-improving with usage

### 2. **Semantic Categorization** (`SemanticCategorizer.js`)
- Uses **seed words** for each category (camera, lighting, actions, etc.)
- Calculates **semantic similarity** using word overlap and context
- Analyzes **surrounding context** (100 characters) to choose best category
- Learns **co-occurrence patterns** - which phrases appear in which categories
- Stores **user corrections** when you manually recategorize

**Key Features:**
- Context-aware categorization
- Self-correcting based on usage patterns
- User feedback integration
- Category weight adjustment based on engagement

### 3. **Behavior Learning Engine** (`BehaviorLearningEngine.js`)
- Tracks every highlight shown to you
- Records which highlights you click on
- Records which highlights you ignore
- Uses **reinforcement learning** to adjust confidence scores
- Implements **exploration vs exploitation** balance (shows new patterns occasionally)

**Learning Metrics:**
- Click-through rate per phrase
- Category engagement scores
- Time-based relevance decay
- Phrase quality scores (0-1 range)

**Key Features:**
- Positive reinforcement: clicked phrases get boosted
- Negative reinforcement: ignored phrases get reduced
- Exploration rate: 15% chance to show uncertain patterns (configurable)
- Learning rate: 0.1 (how quickly to adapt)

### 4. **Adaptive Pattern Engine** (`AdaptivePatternEngine.js`)
- **Orchestrates** all the subsystems
- Processes text through the entire pipeline
- Resolves overlapping matches intelligently
- Filters by learned confidence thresholds
- Tracks performance metrics

**Processing Pipeline:**
1. Auto-correct typos (fuzzy matching)
2. Extract important phrases (TF-IDF)
3. Find phrase occurrences in text
4. Categorize each occurrence (semantic)
5. Apply behavior learning (adjust confidence)
6. Filter by shouldShow() (exploration/exploitation)
7. Resolve overlaps (prefer longer, higher-confidence)
8. Return final highlights

## User Interaction & Learning

### How the System Learns From You

1. **When you see a highlight:**
   - System records it was shown
   - Updates phrase frequency statistics
   - Increments category usage counter

2. **When you click a highlight:**
   - Positive reinforcement: phrase score increases
   - Category engagement increases
   - Co-occurrence pattern strengthens
   - Future confidence boosted by +10-20 points

3. **When you ignore a highlight:**
   - Negative reinforcement: phrase score decreases slightly
   - Future confidence reduced by ~5 points
   - System learns your preferences

4. **Over time:**
   - High-engagement phrases appear more
   - Low-engagement phrases appear less
   - Categories you use most get prioritized
   - System adapts to your specific domain

## Performance & Statistics

### Access System Statistics

Open browser console and run:

```javascript
// Get comprehensive statistics
adaptiveEngine.getStatistics()

// Get insights and recommendations
adaptiveEngine.getInsights()

// Get top performing patterns
adaptiveEngine.getTopPatterns(20)

// Get category performance
adaptiveEngine.getCategoryPerformance()

// Export all data for analysis
adaptiveEngine.exportData()
```

### Example Output:

```javascript
{
  extractor: {
    totalDocuments: 45,
    uniqueTerms: 1247,
    topTerms: [...]
  },
  categorizer: {
    categories: 9,
    seedWords: 126,
    learnedPatterns: 234,
    userCorrections: 12
  },
  learner: {
    totalPhrases: 456,
    totalInteractions: 1234,
    totalClicks: 178,
    overallClickRate: "14.42%"
  },
  performance: {
    averageProcessingTime: "23.45ms",
    samples: 45
  }
}
```

## Configuration

### Adjust System Parameters

```javascript
// Configure thresholds and rates
adaptiveEngine.configure({
  minConfidence: 50,        // Minimum confidence to show (0-100)
  maxHighlights: 100,       // Maximum highlights per text
  learningRate: 0.1,        // How quickly to adapt (0.01-1.0)
  explorationRate: 0.15     // % chance to show uncertain patterns (0-1)
});

// Get current configuration
adaptiveEngine.getConfiguration()
```

**Parameter Guide:**
- **minConfidence**: Lower = more highlights (but lower quality), Higher = fewer highlights (but higher quality)
- **maxHighlights**: Prevents over-highlighting long documents
- **learningRate**: Higher = adapt faster (but may overfit), Lower = adapt slower (but more stable)
- **explorationRate**: Higher = show more new patterns (learn faster), Lower = show proven patterns (more consistent)

## Data Storage

All learning data is stored in **localStorage** and persists across sessions:

- `intelligentPhraseExtractor` - Document frequency and n-gram statistics
- `semanticCategorizer` - Co-occurrence patterns and user corrections
- `behaviorLearningEngine` - Phrase engagement and category performance

### Reset System

```javascript
// Reset all learning (fresh start)
adaptiveEngine.resetLearning()

// Or reset individual components
intelligentExtractor.reset()
semanticCategorizer.reset()
behaviorLearner.reset()
```

- Prioritizes phrases over individual words
- Weighs by statistical significance

### 3. Context Analysis
- Analyzes 50-100 characters around each match
- Considers nearby category indicators
- Boosts confidence when context aligns
- Reduces confidence when context conflicts

### 4. Adaptive Confidence
- Base confidence from extractor (TF-IDF score)
- Adjusted by categorizer (semantic fit)
- Modified by learner (user behavior)
- Final decision by exploration/exploitation

## FAQ

**Q: Will it work on the first document?**
A: Yes! The system has seed words for each category and uses TF-IDF on the first document. It improves with each document you process.

**Q: How many documents until it's "trained"?**
A: It starts working immediately and noticeably improves after 10-20 documents. Fully mature after 50-100 documents.

**Q: Can I reset if I don't like how it learned?**
A: Yes! Run `adaptiveEngine.resetLearning()` in console for a fresh start.

**Q: Does it work offline?**
A: Yes! Everything runs client-side in browser. No API calls.

**Q: What if I want specific patterns highlighted?**
A: Click on those patterns when you see them. The system will learn to prioritize them. You can also add seed words to categories.

**Q: Is my data private?**
A: Yes! All learning data stays in your browser's localStorage. Nothing is sent to servers.

## Next Steps

The system is ready to use! It will:
1. Start learning from your first document
2. Improve with each document you process
3. Adapt to your clicking behavior
4. Get smarter over time

**No configuration needed** - just use it naturally!
